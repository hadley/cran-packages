Description: Zelig is an easy-to-use program that can estimate, and
        help interpret the results of, an enormous range of statistical
        models. It literally is ``everyone's statistical software''
        because Zelig's simple unified framework incorporates everyone
        else's (R) code. We also hope it will become ``everyone's
        statistical software'' for applications and teaching, and so
        have designed Zelig so that anyone can easily use it or add
        their programs to it.  Zelig also comes with infrastructure
        that facilitates the use of any existing method, such as by
        allowing multiply imputed data for any model, and mimicking the
        program Clarify (for Stata) that takes the raw output of
        existing statistical procedures and translates them into
        quantities of direct interest.
