Description: This package intends to provide a platform where EDAs
        (Estimation of Distribution Algorithms) based on copulas can be
        implemented and studied. It contains complete implementations
        of various EDAs based on copulas and vines and also offers the
        possibility of implementing new algorithms that can be
        integrated into the package. EDAs are implemented using S4
        classes with generic functions for its main parts: seeding,
        selection, learning, sampling, replacement, local optimization,
        termination, and reporting. The package also provides a group
        of well-known benchmark problems and utility functions to study
        the behavior of EDAs.
