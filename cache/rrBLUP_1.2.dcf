Description: At the core of this package is the function mixed.solve,
        which contains a fast ML/REML algorithm for mixed models with
        one variance component (other than the residual error).  This
        algorithm can be used for association analysis (function GWA)
        and genomic prediction (function kinship.BLUP), for which
        several kinship models are available (e.g., realized
        relationship and Gaussian).
