Description: The package BayHap performs simultaneous estimation of
        uncertain haplotype frequencies and association with haplotypes
        based on generalized linear models for quantitative, binary and
        survival traits. Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte
        Carlo techniques are the theoretical framework for the methods
        of estimation included in this package. Prior values for model
        parameters can be included by the user. Convergence diagnostics
        and statistical and graphical analysis of the sampling output
        can be also carried out.
