Title: Diagnostic accuracy of classification models.
Author: Sergej Potapov, Werner Adler and Berthold Lausen.
Description: Several functions for evaluating the accuracy of
        classification models. The package provide the following
        performance measures: "cv", "0.632" and "0.632+" estimation of
        the misclassification rate, sensitivity, specifity and auc. If
        an application is computationally intensive, parallel execution
        can be used to reduce the time taken.
