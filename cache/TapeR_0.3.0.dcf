Description: This package implements functions for fitting taper curves
        (a semiparametric linear mixed effects taper model) to diameter
        measurements along stems. Further functions are provided to
        estimate the uncertainty around the predicted curves, to
        calculate timber volume (also by sections) and marginal (e.g.,
        upper) diameters. Uncertainties of single tree volume
        predictions resulting from uncertainties in the taper equations
        tree height models (tariffs) are provided.  The example data
        include the taper curve parameters for Norway spruce used in
        the 3rd German NFI fitted to 380 trees and a subset of
        section-wise diameter measurements of these trees. The
        functions implemented here are detailed in the following
