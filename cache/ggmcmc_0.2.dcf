Package: ggmcmc
Title: Graphical tools for analyzing Markov Chain Monte Carlo
        simulations from Bayesian inference.
Description: ggmcmc is a tool for assessing and diagnosing convergence
        of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, as well as for
        graphically display results from full MCMC analysis. The
        package also facilitates the graphical interpretation of models
        by providing flexible functions to plot the results against
        observed variables.
