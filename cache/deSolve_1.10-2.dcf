Description: Functions that solve initial value problems of a system of
        first-order ordinary differential equations (ODE), of partial
        differential equations (PDE), of differential algebraic
        equations (DAE), and of delay differential equations. The
        functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions lsoda,
        lsodar, lsode, lsodes of the ODEPACK collection, to the FORTRAN
        functions dvode and daspk and a C-implementation of solvers of
        the Runge-Kutta family with fixed or variable time steps. The
        package contains routines designed for solving ODEs resulting
        from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial differential equations (PDE) that
        have been converted to ODEs by numerical differencing.
