Description: A tableplot is a visualisation of a (large) statistical
        dataset with a dozen of variables, both both numeric and
        categorical. Each column represents a variable and each row bin
        is an aggregate of a certain number of records. The values of
        cells are depicted as horizontal bars. Missing values are taken
        into account. A GUI has been implemented which is used to
        easily customize the tableplot. Also supports large ffdf
        datasets from the ff package.
