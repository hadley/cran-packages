Description: Tools to using fonts other than the standard PostScript
        fonts.  This package makes it easy to use system TrueType fonts
        and with PDF or PostScript output files. It can also be used
        with fonts packaged specifically to be used with it, such as
        the fontcm package, which has Computer Modern PostScript fonts
        with math symbols.  See https://github.com/wch/extrafont for
        instructions and examples.
