Description: The NOIA model, as described extensively in Alvarez-Castro
        & Carlborg (2007), is a framework facilitating the estimation
        of genetic effects and genotype-to-phenotype maps. This package
        provides the basic tools to perform linear and multilinear
        regressions from real populations (provided the phenotype and
        the genotype of every individuals), estimating the genetic
        effects from different reference points, the genotypic values,
        and the decomposition of genetic variances in a multi-locus, 2
        alleles system. This package is presented in Le Rouzic &
        Alvarez-Castro (2008).
