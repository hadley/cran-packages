Title: An individual-based population genetic simulation environment
License: GPL
Description: An interface between R and the metasim simulation engine.
        Facilitates the use of the metasim engine to build and run
        individual based population genetics simulations. The
        simulation environment is documented in: Allan Strand. Metasim
        1.0: an individual-based environment for simulating population
        genetics of complex population dynamics. Mol. Ecol. Notes,
        2:373-376, 2002. (Please contact Allan Strand with comments,
        bug reports, etc). This version represents a significant
        alteration of function names that hopefully increases
        consistency and reduces the chances of collisions with other
        packages naming conventions.  For a spatially-explicit, but
        slower, package with a similar interface, see kernelPop
