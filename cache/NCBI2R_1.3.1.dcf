Description: NCBI2R is a R package that annotates lists of SNPs and/or
        genes, with current information from NCBI, including LD
        information. Functions are provided that with one command will
        provide annotation of the results from genome wide association
        studies to provide a broader context of their meaning. Other
        functions enable comparisons between a user's GWA results, and
        candidate snp/gene lists that are created from keywords, such
        as specific diseases, phenotypes or gene ontology terms.
        Commands are simple to follow and designed to work with R
        objects to integrate into existing workflows. The output
        produces text fields and weblinks to more information for items
        such as: gene descriptions, nucleotide positions, OMIM,
        pathways, phenotypes, and lists of interacting and neighboring
        genes. Annotation can then be used in R for further analysis,
        or the objects can be customized for use in spreadsheet
        programs or web browsers. The NCBI2R package was designed to
        allow those performing genome analysis to produce output that
        could easily be understood by a person not familiar with R.
        Please see the new website at http://NCBI2R.wordpress.com for
        more information. The internet is required for almost all of
        these functions.
