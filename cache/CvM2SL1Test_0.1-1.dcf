Description: The package contains two functions for L1-version of
        Cramer-von Mises Tests: one computes Cramer-von Mises two
        sample test scores, the other cmoputes the exact p-value(s) for
        given Cramer-von Mises two-sample test score(s) under the
        assumption that the populations under comparison have the same
        probability distribution. The L1-version Cramer-von Mises test,
        like its L2 counterpart, is distribution-free, but of less
        computational intensity. In certain cases, this version of
        Cramer-von Mises test is almost as powerful as its L2
        counterpart. Simulation study also shows that it is more
        powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in certain cases.
