Description: Analyses individually geo-referenced multilocus genotypes
        for the inferences of genetic boundaries between populations.
        It is based on the wombling method that estimates the systemic
        function by looking for the local variation of the allele
        frequencies. The systemic function estimation is based on the
        local polynomial regression, and a binomial test assess the
        significance of boundaries. The method applies to codominant or
        dominant markers and allows for missing data.
