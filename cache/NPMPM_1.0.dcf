Description: The main method npmpm calculates bacterial concentrations
        during food manufacture after a contamination. Variability and
        uncertainty are included by use of probability distributions
        and Monte Carlo Simulation. The model aims at predicting
        possible bacterial concentrations at one certain point in time
        s, e.g. at the end of a process chain. The process steps of
        this process chain are run through in linear order.
        Experimental data that match current process step conditions
        are gathered, and one deterministic primary model is fitted to
        every series of measured values. From every fitted curve one
        concentration of bacteria at time s is computed, yielding a set
        of concentrations. This sample of possible contamination sizes
        is assumed to follow a certain probability distribution. After
        calculation of distribution parameters, one value is randomly
        drawn from this probability distribution. This value may be
        modified, and then serves as contamination for the next process
        step.
