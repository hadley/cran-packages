Description: Assuming diagnostic marker increase monotonically and
        stochatically with disease severity, the R package provides
        utilities to estimate two diagnostic test summary measures for
        three ordinal groups ----volume under ROC surface (VUS) and the
        extended Youden index. Variance, confidence interval and
        optimal cut-points both under the normal assumption and also
        the non-parametric method(s) will be provided for the summary
        measures. Statistical tests are implemented to compare multiple
        diagnostic tests and two diagnostic test. Sample size is
        calculated to estimate the summary measures within
        user-specified margin of error for future study planning.
