Description: By combining constant, linear, and quadratic local models,
  lazy estimates the value of an unknown multivariate function on
  the basis of a set of possibly noisy samples of the function itself.
  This implementation of lazy learning automatically adjusts the
  bandwidth on a query-by-query basis through a leave-one-out
  cross-validation.
