Description: This package provides some useful functions for calculating quality
 measures for
 adjustment, including statistics Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises and Anderson-Darling.
 These statistics are often used to compare models not equipped. Also provided are other measures
 of fitness, such as AIC, CAIC, BIC and HQIC. The package also provides functions for generating
 pseudo-random number of random variables that follow the following probability distributions: Kumaraswamy Birnbaum-Saunders, Kumaraswamy Pareto, Exponentiated Weibull
 and Kumaraswamy Weibull.
