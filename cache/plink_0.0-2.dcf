Description: This package uses unidimensional item response theory methods to compute linking 
    constants and conduct chain linking of tests for multiple groups under a nonequivalent groups 
    common item design.  It allows for mean/mean, mean/sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord calibrations 
    of single-format or mixed-format dichotomous (1PL, 2PL, and 3PL) and polytomous (graded response
    partial credit/generalized partial credit, nominal, and multiple-choice model) common items.
