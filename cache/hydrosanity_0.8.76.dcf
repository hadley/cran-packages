Description: Hydrosanity provides a graphical user interface for exploring hydrological
  time series. It is designed to work with catchment surface hydrology data 
  (mainly rainfall and streamflow time series at a set of locations). 
  There are functions to import from a database or files; 
  summarise and visualise the dataset in various ways;
  estimate areal rainfall;
  fill gaps in rainfall data;
  and estimate the rainfall-runoff relationship.
  Probably the most useful features are the interactive graphical displays of
  a spatial set of time series.
  WARNING: this package is under development and should not be considered stable.
  An introductory paper is included, but there is not much detailed documentation.
  Hydrosanity's Graphical User Interface was based on Rattle by Graham Williams.
