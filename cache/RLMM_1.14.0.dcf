Description: A classification algorithm, based on a multi-chip,
        multi-SNP approach for Affymetrix SNP arrays. Using a large
        training sample where the genotype labels are known, this
        aglorithm will obtain more accurate classification results on
        new data. RLMM is based on a robust, linear model and uses the
        Mahalanobis distance for classification. The chip-to-chip
        non-biological variation is removed through normalization. This
        model-based algorithm captures the similarities across genotype
        groups and probes, as well as thousands other SNPs for accurate
        classification. NOTE: 100K-Xba only at for now.
