Title: Non-Negative Sparse PCA
Description: This package implements two methods for performing a
        principal component analysis (PCA) with constraints, where
        non-negativity and/or sparsity constraints are enforced on the
        principal axes (PAs).  The function 'nsprcomp' computes one
        principal component (PC) after the other. Each PA is optimized
        such that the corresponding PC has maximum variance under the
        given constraints. Then the data matrix is deflated using one
        of several provided deflation methods, and the process is
        repeated with the deflated data matrix to compute the next PC.
        In contrast, the function 'nscumcomp' jointly computes all PCs
        such that the cumulative variance is maximal, subject to an
        upper bound on the divergence from orthonormality of the
        rotation matrix.  Both functions have the same interface as the
        'prcomp' function from the 'stats' package (plus some extra
        parameters), and both return the result of the analysis as an
        object of class 'nsprcomp', which inherits from 'prcomp'.
