Description: httpuv provides low-level socket and protocol support for
        handling HTTP and WebSocket requests directly from within R. It
        is primarily intended as a building block for other packages,
        rather than making it particularly easy to create complete web
        applications using httpuv alone. httpuv is built on top of the
        libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of which were developed
        by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser
        license information.)
