Description: A minimum distance estimator is calculated for an imprecise probability model.
  The imprecise probability model consists of upper coherent previsions whose credal sets are given
  by a finite number of constraints on the expectations. The parameter set is finite. The estimator chooses
  that parameter such that the empirical measure lies next to the corresponding credal set with respect to
  the total variation norm.
