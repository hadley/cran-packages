Description: gRapHD is designed for efficient selection of
        high-dimensional undirected graphical models. The package
        provides tools for selecting trees, forests and decomposable
        models minimizing information criteria such as AIC or BIC, and
        for displaying the independence graphs of the models. It has
        also some useful tools for analysing graphical structures. It
        supports the use of discrete, continuous, or both types of
        variables.
