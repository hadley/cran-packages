Description: Bi-variate data fitting is done by two ingredients: the margins and the dependency structure. The dependency structure is modeled through a copula. An algorithm was implemented considering seven families of copulas  (Generalized Archimedean Copulas), the best fitting can be obtained looking all copula's options. Different dependence's kind was considered (totally positive of order 2 and stochastically increasing).
