        R
Author: Roger Bivand
Maintainer: Roger Bivand <Roger.Bivand@nhh.no>
Description: Interface between GRASS 5.0 geographical information
        system and R, based on starting R from within the GRASS
        environment using values of environment variables set in the
        GISRC file. Interface examples should be run outside GRASS,
        others may be run within. Wrapper and helper functions are
        provided for a range of R functions to match the interface
        metadata structures.
Depends: R (>= 2.2.0)
