Description: "geneListPie" package is for mapping a gene list to
        function categories defined in GOSlim or Kegg. The results can
        be plotted as a pie chart to provide a quick view of the genes
        distribution of the gene list among the function categories.
        The gene list must contain a list of gene symbols. The package
        contains a set of pre-processed gene sets obtained from Gene
        Ontology and MSigDB including human, mouse, rat and yeast. To
        provide a high level concise view, only GO slim and kegg are
        provided. The gene sets are regulared updated. User can also
        use customized gene sets. User can use the R Pie() or Pie3D()
        function for plotting the pie chart. Users can also choose to
        output the gene function mapping results and use external
        software such as Excel(R) for ploting.
