Title: Statistical Analysis of Haplotypes with Traits and Covariates when Linkage Phase is Ambiguous
Author: Jason P. Sinnwell and Daniel J. Schaid
Maintainer: Jason P. Sinnwell <sinnwell.jason@mayo.edu>
Description: Haplo Stats is a suite of S-PLUS/R routines for the analysis of indirectly measured haplotypes. The statistical methods assume that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are ambiguous (due to unknown linkage phase of the genetic markers). The genetic markers are assumed to be codominant (i.e., one-to-one correspondence between their genotypes and their phenotypes), and so we refer to the measurements of genetic markers as genotypes. The main functions in Haplo Stats are:  haplo.em, haplo.glm and haplo.score.
