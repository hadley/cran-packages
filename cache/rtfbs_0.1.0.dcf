Title: R Transcription Factor Binding Site identification tool
Author: Nicholas Peterson, Andre Martins, Melissa Hubisz, and Adam
        Siepel
Description: RTFBS identifies and scores possible Transcription Factor
        Binding Sites and allows for FDR analysis and pruning.  It
        supports splitting of sequences based on size or a specified
        GFF, grouping by GC content, and specification of Markov model
        order.  The heavy lifting is done in C while all results are
        made available via R.
