Description: A suite of functions to compute confidence intervals and
        necessary sample sizes for the parameter p of the Bernoulli
        B(p) distribution under simple random sampling or under pooled
        sampling. Such computations are e.g. of interest when
        investigating the incidence or prevalence in populations. The
        package contains functions to compute coverage probabilities
        and coverage coefficients of the provided confidence intervals
        procedures. Sample size calculations are based on expected
        length.
