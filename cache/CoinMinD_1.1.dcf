Description: Methods for obtaining simultaneous confidence interval for
        multinomial proportion have been proposed by many authors and
        the present study include a variety of widely applicable
        procedures. Seven classical methods (Wilson, Quesenberry and
        Hurst, Goodman, Wald with and without continuity correction,
        Fitzpatrick and Scott, Sison and Glaz) and Bayesian Dirichlet
        models are included in the package. The advantage of MCMC pack
        has been exploited to derive the Dirichlet posterior directly
        and this also helps in handling the Dirichlet prior parameters.
        This package is prepared to have equal and unequal values for
        the Dirichlet prior distribution that will provide better scope
        for data analysis and associated sensitivity analysis.
