Description: This package represents a bare-bones implementation of an
        interface to the core Familias functions (www.familias.name),
        which are programmed in C++.  The package itself functions as a
        kind of database, where information about persons, pedigrees,
        allele systems and observations for persons are entered
        stepwise. In the end, probability calculations are made.
