Description: A suite of tools for inference about text documents and
        associated sentiment.  This includes the `mnlm' function, for
        sparse multinomial inverse regression analysis of sentiment in
        text, `pls', a concise partial least squares routine, and the
        `topics' function (beta version), for efficient estimation and
        model selection in latent topic representations of text.
