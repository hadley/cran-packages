Description: Calculates twelve commonly-used, basic measures of food
        web network structure from binary, predator-prey matrices:
        species richness, connectance, total number of links, link
        density, number of trophic positions, predator:prey ratio, and
        fraction of carnivores, herbivores, top species and
        intermediate species.  Employs food web language in the code
        and output, translates between a couple of common food web
        formats, can handle food webs consisting of multiple levels,
        and can automate the analysis for a large number of webs. The
        program produces 3-dimensional graphs of high quality that can
        be customized by the user.
