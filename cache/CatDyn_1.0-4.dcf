Description: Using catch in biomass, fishing effort, and mean body mass
        by time step, estimate stock abundance, natural mortality rate,
        and fishing operational parameters. It includes methods for
        plotting standard exploratory and analytical plots and to
        pre-process data, five types of catch dynamics models of
        increasing complexity, and two distributions for the catch
        data.
