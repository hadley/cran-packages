Description: TDM can be used to estimate individual pharmacokinetic
        parameters with one or more drug serum/plasma concentrations
        obtained from a single subject or multiple subjects using
        OpenBUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) interfaced
        through BRugs. Besides, it also can calculate a suggested dose
        with the target drug concentration (C ->D) or calculate a
        predicted drug concentration with a given dose (D -> C).
