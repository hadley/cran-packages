Description: PLIS is a multiple testing procedure for testing several
        groups of hypotheses. Linear dependency is expected from the
        hypotheses within the same group and is modeled by hidden
        Markov Models. It is noted that, for PLIS, a smaller p value
        does not necessarily imply more significance because of
        dependency among the hypotheses. A typical application of PLIS
        is to analyze genome wide association studies datasets, where
        SNPs from the same chromosome are treated as a group and
        exhibit strong linear genomic dependency.
