Description: DDEPN (Dynamic Deterministic Effects Propagation
        Networks): Infer signalling networks for timecourse data. Given
        a matrix of high-throughput genomic or proteomic timecourse
        data, generated after external perturbation of the biological
        system, DDEPN models the time-dependent propagation of active
        and passive states depending on a network structure. Optimal
        network structures given the experimental data are
        reconstructed. Two network inference algorithms can be used:
        inhibMCMC, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling approach and GA,
        a Genetic Algorithm network optimisation. Inclusion of prior
        biological knowledge can be done using different network prior
        models.
