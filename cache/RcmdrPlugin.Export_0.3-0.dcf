Title: Graphically export output to LaTeX or HTML
Author: Liviu Andronic
Maintainer: Liviu Andronic <landronimirc@gmail.com>
Depends: Rcmdr (>= 1.3-12), xtable, Hmisc
Description: The package helps users to graphically export Rcmdr output
        to LaTeX or HTML code, via xtable() or Hmisc::latex(). The
        plug-in was originally intended to facilitate exporting Rcmdr
        output to formats other than ASCII text and to provide R
        novices with an easy-to-use, easy-to-access reference on
        exporting R objects to formats suited for printed output. The
        package documentation contains several pointers on creating
        reports, either by using conventional word processors or
        LaTeX/LyX.
