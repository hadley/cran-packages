Description: This package provides functions to analyze microscopy
        based cytometry datasets. It was originally design for
        Cell-ID's output, but can be adapted to other image
        segmentation programs. It includes functions for loading,
        manipulating and plotting the data. It can also create cell's
        images montages in a user defined layout.
