Title: Create cryptographic hash digests of R objects
Description: The digest package provides functions for the creation of
        `hash' digests of arbitrary R objects using the md5, sha-1,
        sha-256 and crc32 algorithms permitting easy comparison of R
        language objects. The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified
        in RFC 1321, the SHA-1 and SHA-256 algorithms are specified in
        FIPS-180-1 and FIPS-180-2, and the crc32 algorithm is described
        in ftp://ftp.rocksoft.com/cliens/rocksoft/papers/crc_v3.txt.
        For md5, sha-1 and sha-256, this packages uses small standalone
        C implementations that were provided by Christophe Devine. For
        crc32, code from the zlib library is used.
 .
 Please note that this package is not meant to be deployed for
        cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely
        tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
