Description: A package providing methods for cubature (numerical integration)
             over polygonal domains.
             Currently, four cubature methods are implemented:
             the two-dimensional midpoint rule (a simple wrapper around
             spatstat::as.im.function), the product Gauss cubature proposed
             by Sommariva and Vianello (2007), an adaptive cubature for
             isotropic functions via line integrate() along the boundary,
             and quasi-exact methods specific to the integration of the
             bivariate Gaussian density over polygonal and circular domains.
             For cubature over simple hypercubes, the
             packages cubature and R2Cuba are more appropriate.
