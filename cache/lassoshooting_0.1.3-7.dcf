Description: L1 regularized regression (Lasso) solver using the Cyclic
        Coordinate Descent algorithm aka Lasso Shooting is fast. This
        implementation can choose which coefficients to penalize. It
        support coefficient-specific penalities and it can take X'X and
        X'y instead of X and y.
