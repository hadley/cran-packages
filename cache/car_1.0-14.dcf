Description: 
  This package accompanies J. Fox, An R and S-PLUS Companion to Applied Regression,
  Sage, 2002.
  The package contains mostly functions for applied regression, linear models, and
  generalized linear models, with an emphasis on regression diagnostics, particularly 
  graphical diagnostic methods. There are also some utility functions. 
  With some exceptions, I have tried not to duplicate capabilities in the basic distribution of R, 
  nor in widely used packages. Where relevant, the functions in car are consistent with 
  na.action = na.omit or na.exclude.
