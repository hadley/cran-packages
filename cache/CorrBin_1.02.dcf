Description: This package implements non-parametric analyses for
        clustered binary data. The elements of the cluster are assumed
        exchangeable, and identical joint distribution (also known as
        marginal compatibility, or reproducibility) is assumed for
        clusters of different sizes. A trend test based on stochastic
        ordering is implemented.
