Description: Permutation tests are commonly used. Usually it doesn't
        take much time to do a permutation test, but it can be
        time-consuming if one have to do many permutation tests (e.g.,
        in gene data analysis) at the same time.  This package allows
        users to do sequential permutation tests which can save lots of
        time. This package has implemented (both in R and C++ version)
        the two sequential permutation tests discussed in the paper
        Bancroft, Du and Nettleton (2013).  It also allows users to do
        general sequential permutation test by offering user-defined
        functions for calculating observed and permuted test
        statistics. For people who are confident in writing C++ code
        and willing to use C++ code to speed up computation, this
        package tries all efforts to make this easy (thanks to Rcpp and
        C++ variadic template). Basically a user only has to offer C++
        code for calculating observed and permuted test statistics
        (similar to what he/she would do using pure R code).
