Title: A few GPU enabled functions
Author: Josh Buckner <nullsatz@gmail.com>, Mark Seligman

Maintainer: Josh Buckner <nullsatz@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.8.0)
SystemRequirements: Nvidia's CUDA toolkit (>= release 2.3)
Description: This package provides R interfaces to a handful of common
        statistical algorithms. These algorithms are implemented in
        parallel using a mixture of Nvidia's CUDA language, Nvidia's
        CUBLAS library, and EMI Photonics' CULA libraries. On a
        computer equipped with an Nvidia GPU some of these functions
        may be substantially more efficient than native R routines.
        Thanks to Craig Stark at UC Irvine for donating time on his
        lab's Mac hardware.
