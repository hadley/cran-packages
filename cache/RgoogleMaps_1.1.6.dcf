Description: This package serves two purposes: (i) Provide a
        comfortable R interface to query the Google server for static
        maps, and (ii) Use the map as a background image to overlay
        plots within R. This requires proper coordinate scaling. NOTE:
        To do anything but downloading static map tiles, RgoogleMaps
        needs EITHER rgdal OR ReadImages OR rimage installed ! Such an
        OR dependency is difficult to express in the Depends field, so
        I moved those packages to suggested. rgdal is your package if
        you prefer png file format and ReadImages or rimage if you
        prefer jpg format. In the latter cases, you will also need the
        libjpeg library installed.
