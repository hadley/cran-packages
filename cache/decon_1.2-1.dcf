Description: This package contains a collection of functions to deal
        with nonparametric measurement error problems using
        deconvolution kernel methods. We focus two measurement error
        models in the package: (1) an additive measurement error model,
        where the goal is to estimate the density or distribution
        function from contaminated data; (2) nonparametric regression
        model with errors-in-variables. The R functions allow the
        measurement errors to be either homoscedastic or
        heteroscedastic. To make the deconvolution estimators
        computationally more efficient in R, we adapt the "Fast Fourier
        Transform" (FFT) algorithm for density estimation with
        error-free data to the deconvolution kernel estimation. Several
        methods for the selection of the data-driven smoothing
        parameter are also provided in the package.  See "Deconvolution
        Estimation in Measurement Error Models: The R Package decon" by
        Wang, X.F. and Wang, B. for details.
