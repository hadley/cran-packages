Title: Estimation of CPDAG/PAG and causal inference using the IDA
        algorithm
Description: Standard and robust estimation of the equivalence class of
        a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via the PC-Algorithm. The
        equivalence class is represented by its (unique) Completete
        Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (CPDAG). Furthermore, a PAG
        instead of a CPDAG can be estimated if latent variables and/or
        selection variables are assumed to be present. Functions for
        causal inference using the IDA algorithm (based on do-calculus
        of Judea Pearl) are provided for CPDAGs.
