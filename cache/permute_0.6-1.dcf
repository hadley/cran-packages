Description: The 'permute' package implements a set of restricted
        permutation designsfor freely exchangeable, line transects
        (time series), and spatial grid designs plus permutation of
        blocks (groups of samples). 'permute' also allows split-plot
        designs, in which the whole-plots or split-plots or both can be
        freely-exchangeble or one of the restricted designs.
