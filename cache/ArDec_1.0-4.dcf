Description: Package ArDec implements the autoregressive decomposition of a time series based on the constructive approach in West (1997). Particular cases include the extraction of trend and seasonal components from a monthly time series. Uncertainty on the resulting components can be derived from sampling of the autoregressive model which is written as a linear regression model and handled on a Bayesian framework.
