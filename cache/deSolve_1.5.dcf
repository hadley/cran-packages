Description: Functions that solve initial value problems of a system of
        first-order ordinary differential equations (ODE), of partial
        differential equations (PDE) and of differential algebraic
        equations (DAE). The functions provide an interface to the
        FORTRAN functions lsoda, lsodar, lsode, lsodes of the ODEPACK
        collection, to the FORTRAN functions dvode and daspk and a
        C-implementation of solvers of the Runge-Kutta family with
        fixed or variable time steps. The package contains routines
        designed for solving ODEs resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D
        partial differential equations (PDE) that have been converted
        to ODEs by numerical differencing.
