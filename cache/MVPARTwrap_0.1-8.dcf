Title: Wrap functions of mvpart function providing for instance a more
        descriptive tree, the discriminant species at each node (table
        1 of Dea'th (2002)), the cascade MRT analysis and an adjusted
        R^2 for an MRT model.

Description: The main function of this package, MRT, provides to the following information : the proper cluster membership allocation in the tree, the discriminant species for each cluster, the tree nodes at the proper level of R2 (1-relative error), the total species variance partitionned by species, by the tree, and by the splits of the tree, plus a different graphic representation of the final model in the form of a tree. Moreover, the CascadeMRT function allows a cascade MRT analysis and the CasMRTR2 function allows to illustrate the (unadjusted) variation explained by each wave/drops. Last but not least, the R2aGDF function permits the calculation of an adjusted R^2 for an MRT model.
