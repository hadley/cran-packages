Description: This package provides functions for analyzing the
        association between two or three MRCVs.  A modified Pearson
        chi-square statistic can be used to test for marginal
        independence, or a more general loglinear modeling approach can
        be used to compare various other structures of association.
        Bootstrap- and asymptotic-based standardized residuals and
        model-predicted odds ratios are available, in addition to other
        descriptive information.
