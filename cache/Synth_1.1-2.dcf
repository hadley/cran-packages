Title: Synthetic Control Group Method for Comparative Case Studies
Author: Jens Hainmueller <jhainm@mit.edu> and Alexis Diamond <adiamond@fas.harvard.edu>
Maintainer: Jens Hainmueller <jhainm@mit.edu>
Description: Implements the synthetic control group method for comparative case studies 
             developed in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010). 
			 The synthetic control method allows for effect estimation in settings where a 
			 single unit (a state, country, firm, etc.) is exposed to an event or intervention. 
			 It provides a data-driven procedure to construct synthetic control units based on a weighted 
			 combination of comparison units that approximates the characteristics of 
			 the unit that is exposed to the intervention. A combination of comparison units 
			 often provides a better comparison for the unit exposed to the intervention than
             any comparison unit alone.
