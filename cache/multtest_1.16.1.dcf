Title: Resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing
Version: 1.16.1
Author: Katherine S. Pollard, Yongchao Ge, Sandra Taylor, Sandrine Dudoit
Description: Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based
        multiple testing procedures for controlling the family-wise
        error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER),
        tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP),
        and false discovery rate (FDR). Single-step and step-wise
        methods are implemented. Tests based on a variety of t- and
        F-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression
        parameters from linear and survival models) are included.
        Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values,
        confindence regions and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures
        are directly applicable to identifying differentially
        expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.
