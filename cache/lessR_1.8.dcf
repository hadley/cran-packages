Description: Each function accomplishes the work of several or more
        standard R functions.  For example, two function calls, rad()
        and full(), together read the csv data and generate descriptive
        statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus histograms
        and bar charts for all respective numerical and non-numerical
        variables. The function smd.t.test introduces the ODDSMD plot,
        which displays the Overlapping Density Distributions of two
        independent groups as well as a visual display of the mean
        difference and standardized mean difference. Other functions
        provide for descriptive statistics, the t-test from descriptive
        statistics, a comprehensive regression analysis, color
        plotting, color bar chart, color histogram, color box plot,
        density curves, a calibrated power curve plotted with colors,
        and the reading and display of csv formatted data. The function
        help.me provides a help system that suggests specific analyses
        and functions.
