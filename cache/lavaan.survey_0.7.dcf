Description: Fit structural equation models (SEM) including factor
        analysis, multivariate regression models with latent variables
        and many other latent variable models while correcting
        estimates, standard errors, and chi-square-derived fit measures
        for a complex sampling design.  Incorporate clustering,
        stratification, sampling weights, and finite population
        corrections into a SEM analysis.  Wrapper around packages
