Description: The package contains two functions: one computes the Cramer-von Mises
  two sample test scores, the other cmoputes the exact p-value(s) for given 
  Cramer-von Mises two-sample test score(s) under the assumption that
  the populations under comparison have the same probability distribution.
  Like Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test, Cramer-von Mises test
  is also distribution free. In certain cases, the Cramer-von Mises test 
  is more powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but it is less widely
  used than the latter.
