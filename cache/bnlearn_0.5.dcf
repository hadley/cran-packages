Description: Bayesian network structure learning
  via constraint-based (also known as 'conditional
  independence') algorithms.
  This package implements the Grow-Shrink (GS)
  algorithm, the Incremental Association (IAMB)
  algorithm, the Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB)
  algorithm and the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB)
  algorithm for both discrete and gaussian networks. 
  Simulation and some score functions are
  implemented for discrete networks.
