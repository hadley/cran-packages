Description: Access PubChem data (compounds, substance, assays). Structural information
	     is provided in the form of SMILES strings. This package only provides access
	     to a subset of the precalculated data stored by PubChem. Bio-assay data can
             be accessed to obtain descriptions as well as the actual data. It is also
	     possible to search for assay ID's by keyword. Currently the main limitation is 
	     that only 1000 molecules can be downloaded at a time from the PubChem servers
