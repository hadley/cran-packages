Description: The package `opm' provides tools for analyzing OmniLog(R)
        Phenotype Microarray (PM) data as produced by the device
        distributed by BIOLOG Inc. The package `opmdata' contains the
        entire example dataset from Vaas et al. (2012), which has been
        removed from `opm' due to its size.
