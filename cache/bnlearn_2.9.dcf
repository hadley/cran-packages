Description: Bayesian network structure learning (via constraint-based,
        score-based and hybrid algorithms), parameter learning (via ML
        and Bayesian estimators) and inference.  This package
        implements the Grow-Shrink (GS) algorithm, the Incremental
        Association (IAMB) algorithm, the Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB)
        algorithm, the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the Max-Min
        Parents and Children (MMPC) algorithm, the ARACNE and Chow-Liu
        algorithms, the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search algorithm, the
        Tabu Search (TABU) algorithm, the Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC)
        algorithm and the two-stage Restricted Maximization (RSMAX2)
        algorithm for both discrete and Gaussian networks, along with
        many score functions and conditional independence tests.  Some
        utility functions (model comparison and manipulation, random
        data generation, arc orientation testing, simple and advanced
        plots) are included, as well as support for parameter
        estimation and inference, conditional probability queries and
        cross-validation.
