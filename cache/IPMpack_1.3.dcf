Description: IPMpack takes demographic vital rates and (optionally)
        environmental data to build integral projection models.  A
        number of functional forms for growth and survival can be
        incorporated, as well as a range of reproductive strategies.
        The package also includes a suite of diagnostic routines,
        provides classic matrix model output (e.g., lambda,
        elasticities, sensitivities), and produces post-hoc metrics
        (e.g., passage time and life expectancy).
