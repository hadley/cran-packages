Description: bPeaks is a simple approach to identify transcription
        factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data. Our general philosophy
        is to provide an easy-to-use tool. Instead of complex
        statistical models, bPeaks uses a combination of 4 cutoffs to
        mimic "good peak" properties as described by biologists who
        visually inspect the ChIP-seq data on a genome browser.
