Description: PKgraph provides a graphical user interface for population
        pharmacokinetic model diagnosis. It also provides an integrated
        and comprehensive platform for the analysis of pharmacokinetic
        data including exploratory data analysis, goodness of model
        fit, model validation and model comparison. Results from a
        variety of modeling fitting software, including NONMEM,
        Monolix, SAS and R, can be used. PKgraph is programmed in R,
        and uses the R packages lattice, ggplot2 for static graphics,
        and rggobi for interactive graphics.
