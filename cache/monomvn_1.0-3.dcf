Description: Estimation of multivariate normal data of arbitrary dimension
	     where the pattern of missing data is monotone. Through the use of
	     partial least squares and principal component regressions, 
	     where standard regressions fail,
	     the package can handle an (almost) arbitrary amount of missing
	     data.  The current version supports maximum likelihood inference.
	     Future versions will provide a means of sampling from a Bayesian
	     posterior.
Depends: R (>= 2.5), pls
