Title: R object-oriented programming with or without references
Author: Henrik Bengtsson <henrikb@braju.com>
Maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson <henrikb@braju.com>
Description: Methods and classes for object-oriented programming in R with or without references.  Large effort has been made on making definition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of maintainance for package developers.  For example, generic functions are created automatically, if missing, and name conflict are automatically solved, if possible.  The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those who in the future want to migrate to S4.  The package has been developed since 2001 and is now considered very stable.
