Description: Frailtypack now fits several classes of frailty models
        using a penalized likelihood estimation on the hazard function
        but also a parametrical estimation. 1) A shared gamma frailty
        model and Cox proportional hazard model. Left truncated,
        censored data and strata (max=2) are allowed.  Clustered and
        recurrent survival times can be studied (the
        Andersen-Gill(1982) approach has been implemented for recurrent
        events). An automatic choice of the smoothing parameter is
        possible using an approximated cross-validation procedure. 2)
        Additive frailty models for proportional hazard models with two
        correlated random effects (intercept random effect with random
        slope). 3) Nested frailty models for hierarchically clustered
        data (with 2 levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma
        random effects. 4) Joint frailty models in the context of joint
        modelling of recurrent events with terminal event.
