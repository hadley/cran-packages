 plotting SKEW-T,log p diagrams and wind profiles for data collected by 
 radiosondes (the typical weather balloon-borne instrument), which we
 will call "flights", "sondes", or "profiles" throughout the associated 
 documentation.  The raw data files are in a common format that has a 
 header followed by specific variables.  Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for
