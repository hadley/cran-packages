Title: Protein Sequence Feature Extraction with R
Description: The protr package aims for protein sequence feature
        extraction, which could be easily applied in Bioinformatics and
        Chemogenomics research.  The descriptors listed in this package
        include Amino Acid Composition (Amino Acid
        Composition/Dipeptide Composition/Tripeptide Composition),
        Autocorrelation (Normalized Moreau-Broto Autocorrelation/Moran
        Autocorrelation/Geary Autocorrelation), CTD
        (Composition/Transition/Distribution), Conjoint Traid,
        Quasi-sequence Order (Sequence Order Coupling
        Number/Quasi-sequence Order Descriptors), and Pseudo Amino Acid
        Composition (Pseudo Amino Acid Composition/Amphiphilic Pseudo
        Amino Acid Composition). The package is developed by
        Computational Biology and Drug Design Group, Central South
        University.
