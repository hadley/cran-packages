Title: Tools for spatial data
Author: Doug Nychka
Maintainer: Doug Nychka <nychka@ucar.edu> 
Description: Fields is for curve, surface and function
 fitting with an emphasis on splines, spatial data and spatial statistics. The
 major methods include cubic, robust, and thin plate splines, 
 multivariate Kriging and Kriging for large data sets. One main feature is any
 covariance function implemented in R can be used for spatial prediction. 
 There are also useful functions for plotting and working with 
 spatial data as images. This package also contains an implementation of a
 sparse matrix  methods for large data sets and currently requires the 
 sparse matrix (spam) package for testing (but not for the standard spatial 
 functions.) Use help(fields) to get started and for an overview.
