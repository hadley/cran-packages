Description: Functions to convert Rd to roxygen documentation. It can
        parse an Rd file to a list, create the roxygen documentation
        and update the original R script (e.g. the one containing the
        definition of the function) accordingly. This package also
        provides utilities which can help developers build packages
        using roxygen more easily. The formatR package can be used to
        reformat the R code in the examples sections so that the code
        will be more readable.
