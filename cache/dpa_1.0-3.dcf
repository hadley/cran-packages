Description: A GUI or command-line operated data analysis tool, for
        analyzing time-dependent simulation data in which multiple
        instantaneous or time-lagged relations are assumed. This
        package uses Structural Equation Modeling (the sem package). It
        is aimed to deal with time-dependent data and estimate whether
        a causal diagram fits data from an (agent-based) simulation
        model.
