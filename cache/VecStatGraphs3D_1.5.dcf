Description: This package performs a 3D statistical analysis, both
        numerical and graphic, of a set of vectors. Since a vector has
        three components (a module and two angles) vector analysis is
        performed in two stages: modules are analyzed by means of
        linear statistics and orientations are analyzed by spherical
        statistics. Tests and spherical statistic parameters are
        accompanied by a full range of graphing: vector maps, density
        maps, distribution modules and angles. The tests, spherical
        statistic parameters and graphs allow us detecting another
        distribution properties (I.e. anisotropy) and outliers.
