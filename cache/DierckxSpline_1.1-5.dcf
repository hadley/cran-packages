Description: This package provides a wrapper to the FITPACK routines
        written by Paul Dierckx. The original Fortran is available from
        http://www.netlib.org/dierckx 2012.02.15: This package is
        broken.  Currently, it seems NOT to have any users and is not
        worth fixing.  Dierckx's FITPACK is over 20 years old and seems
        to be obsolete.  If you want to fix it, I'm happy to make you
        the maintainer.  Spencer Graves
