Description: Latticist provides a graphical user interface for
        exploratory visualisation. It is primarily an interface to the
        Lattice graphics system, but also produces displays from the
        vcd package for categorical data. Given a multivariate dataset
        (either a data frame or a table), latticist attempts to produce
        useful displays based on the properties of the data. The
        displays can be customised by editing the calls used to
        generate them.
