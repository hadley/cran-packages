Description: Rmpfr provides (S4 classes and methods for)
  arithmetic including transcendental ("special") functions for
  arbitrary precision floating point numbers. To this end, it interfaces to
  the LGPL'ed MPFR (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable) Library
  which itself is based on the GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) Library.
