Description: This package includes functions used to perform cluster analysis for cognitive 
  diagnosis based on the Asymptotic Classification Theory (Chiu, Douglas & Li, 2009). Given the 
  sample statistic of sum-scores and the item-by-attribute association matrix (Q-matrix; Tatsuoka, 1985), 
  cluster analysis techniques can be used to classify examinees into latent 
  classes based on their attribute patterns. In addition to the algorithms used to classify data, three 
  labeling approaches are proposed to label clusters so that examinees' attribute profiles can be obtained.
