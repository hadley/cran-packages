Description: Amelia II "multiply imputes" missing data in a single
        cross-section (such as a survey), from a time series (like
        variables collected for each year in a country), or from a
        time-series-cross-sectional data set (such as collected by
        years for each of several countries).  Amelia II implements our
        bootstrapping-based algorithm that gives essentially the same
        answers as the standard IP or EMis approaches, is usually
        considerably faster than existing approaches and can handle
        many more variables.  Unlike Amelia I and other statistically
        rigorous imputation software, it virtually never crashes (but
        please let us know if you find to the contrary!).  The program
        also generalizes existing approaches by allowing for trends in
        time series across observations within a cross-sectional unit,
        as well as priors that allow experts to incorporate beliefs
        they have about the values of missing cells in their data.
        Amelia II also includes useful diagnostics of the fit of
        multiple imputation models.  The program works from the R
        command line or via a graphical user interface that does not
        require users to know R.
