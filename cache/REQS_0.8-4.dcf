Description: This package contains the function run.eqs() which calls
        an EQS script file, executes the EQS estimation, and, finally,
        imports the results as R objects. These two steps can be
        performed separately: call.eqs() calls and executes EQS,
        whereas read.eqs() imports existing EQS outputs as objects into
        R.
