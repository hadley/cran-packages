Description: This package creates regular and non-regular Fractional
        Factorial designs. Furthermore, analysis tools for Fractional
        Factorial designs with 2-level factors are offered (main
        effects and interaction plots for all factors simultaneously,
        cube plot for looking at the simultaneous effects of three
        factors, full or half normal plot, alias structure in a more
        readable format than with the built-in function alias). The
        package is still under development. While much of the intended
        functionality is already available, some changes and
        improvements are still to be expected. Suggestions are welcome.
