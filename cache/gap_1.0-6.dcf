Description: This is an integrated package for genetic data analysis
        of both population and family data. Currently it contains
        functions for sample size calculations of both population-based
        and family-based designs, probability of familial disease
        aggregation, kinship calculation, some statistics in linkage
        analysis, and association analysis involving one or more
        genetic markers including haplotype analysis with or without
        environmental covariates.
