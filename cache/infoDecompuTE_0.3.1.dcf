Description: InfoDecompuTE is capable of generating the structure of
        the analysis of variance (ANOVA) table of the two-phase
        experiments. By inputting the design and the relationships of
        the random and fixed factors using the Wilkinson-Rogers'
        syntax, infoDecompuTE can generate the structure of the ANOVA
        table with the coefficients of the variance components for the
        expected mean squares. This package can also study the balanced
        incomplete block design and provides the efficiency factors of
        the fixed effects.
