Title: experiment: R package for designing and analyzing randomized
        experiments

Description: The package provides various statistical methods for
        designing and analyzing randomized experiments. One main
        functionality of the package is the implementation of
        randomized-block and matched-pair designs based on possibly
        multivariate pre-treatment covariates. The package also
        provides the tools to analyze various randomized experiments
        including cluster randomized experiments, randomized
        experiments with noncompliance, and randomized experiments with
        missing data.
