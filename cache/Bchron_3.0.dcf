Description: This package takes dating information to produce joint
        chronological reconstructions for age-depth data. The package
        allows for: radiocarbon and non-radiocarbon depths, thickness
        errors, outlying dates, multiple calibration curves, and event
        prediction. It also produces some pretty pictures, and writes
        all output to files to allow for further analysis (eg
        palaeoclimate reconstruction). There is a menu system for
        users, as well as a command line interface for advanced and/or
        batch processing.
