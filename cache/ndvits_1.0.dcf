Description: The routines extract automatically, for area of interest,
        Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series from
        different optical satellite instruments (AVHRR, Spot
        Vegetation) and to provide tools to display and analyze the
        time series.Functions have been developed to study landscapes
        and more especially to detect changes in land use land cover.
        Phenological metrics can be computed for every season as well
        as vegetation anomaly maps.
