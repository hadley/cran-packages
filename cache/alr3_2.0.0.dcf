Description: This package is a companion to the textbook S. Weisberg
        (2005), "Applied Linear Regression," 3rd edition, Wiley. It
        includes all the data sets discussed in the book (except one),
        and a few functions that are tailored to the methods discussed
        in the book.  As of version 2.0.0, this package depends on the
        car package. Many functions formerly in alr3 have been renamed
        and now reside in car. Data files have beeen lightly modified
        to make some data columns row labels.
