Description: eco is a publicly available R package that implements the
        Bayesian and likelihood methods proposed in Imai, Lu, and
        Strauss (2008) for ecological inference in $2 \times 2$ tables
        as well as the method of bounds introduced by Duncan and Davis
        (1953). The package fits both parametric and nonparametric
        models using either the Expectation-Maximization algorithms
        (for likelihood models) or the Markov chain Monte Carlo
        algorithms (for Bayesian models).  For all models, the
        individual-level data can be directly incorporated into the
        estimation whenever such data are available. Along with
        in-sample and out-of-sample predictions, the package also
        provides a functionality which allows one to quantify the
        effect of data aggregation on parameter estimation and
        hypothesis testing under the parametric likelihood models.
