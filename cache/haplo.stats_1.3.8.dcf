Title: Statistical Analysis of Haplotypes with Traits and Covariates when Linkage Phase is Ambiguous
Author: Sinnwell JP, Schaid DJ, Yu Z
Maintainer: Jason P. Sinnwell <sinnwell.jason@mayo.edu>
Description: A suite of S-PLUS/R routines for the analysis of indirectly measured haplotypes. The statistical methods assume that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are ambiguous (due to unknown linkage phase of the genetic markers). The main functions are: haplo.em, haplo.glm, haplo.score, haplo.power, and seqhap. Copyright: 2003 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.
