Description: ccChooser can be used to developing and evaluation of core
        collections for germplasm collections (entire collection). This
        package used to develop a core collection for biological
        resources like genbanks. A core collection is defined as a
        sample of accessions that represent, with the lowest possible
        level of redundancy, the genetic diversity (the richness of
        gene or genotype categories) of the entire collection. The
        establishing a core collection that represents genetic
        diversity of the entire collection with minimum loss of its
        original diversity and minimum redundancies is an important
        problem for gene-banks curators and crop breeders. ccChooser
        establish core collection base on phenotypic data (agronomic,
        morphological, phenological).
