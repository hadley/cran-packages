Title: Implementation the TrueSkill algorithm in R
Description: An implementation of the TrueSkill algorithm (Herbrich,
        R., Minka, T. and Grapel, T) in R; a Bayesian skill rating
        system with inference by approximate message passing on a
        factor graph. Used by Xbox to rank gamers and identify
        appropriate matches.

        Current version allows for one player per team. Will update as
        time permits.  Requires R version 3.0 as it is written with
        Reference Classes.  URL:
