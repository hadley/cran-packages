Description: Simultaneous clustering of rows and columns, usually
        designated by biclustering, co-clustering or block clustering,
        is an important technique in two way data analysis. It consists
        of estimating a mixture model which takes into account the
        block clustering problem on both the individual and variables
        sets. The blockcluster package provides a bridge between the
        C++ core library and the R statistical computing environment.
        This package allows to co-cluster Binary, contingency and
        continuous data-sets. It also provides utility functions to
        visualize the results. This package may be useful for various
        applications in fields of Data mining,Information retrieval,
        Biology, computer vision and many more.
