Description: This package currently provides a variety of functions for
        producing simple weighted statistics, such as weighted
        Pearson's correlations, partial correlations, Chi-Squareds,
        histograms, and t-tests.  Also now includes some software for
        quickly recoding survey data.  Future versions of the package
        will be more closely integrated with anesrake and additional
        weighting tools and will provide the option to find weighting
        benchmarks and weight data using a variety of methodologies.
        NOTE: Weighted partial correlation calculations temporarily
        pulled to address a bug.
