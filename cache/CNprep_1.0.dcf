Title: pre-process DNA copy number (CN) data for detection of CN events
Version: 1.0
Date: 2012-12-06
Author: Alex Krasnitz, Guoli Sun
Maintainer: Guoli Sun <gsun@cshl.edu>
Description: The package evaluates DNA copy number data, using both
        their intitial form (copy number as a noisy function of genomic
        position) and their approximation by a piecewise-constant
        function (segmentation), for the purpose of identifying genomic
        regions where the copy number differs from the norm.
