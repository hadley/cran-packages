Description: This package provides functions for calculating
        associations between two genes with five correlation
        methods(e.g., the Gini correlation coefficient [GCC], the
        Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient [PCC], the
        Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient [KCC], the Spearman's
        rank correlation coefficient [SCC] and the Tukey's biweight
        correlation coefficient [BiWt], and three non-correlation
        methods (e.g., mutual information [MI] and the maximal
        information-based nonparametric exploration [MINE], and the
        euclidean distance [ED]). It can also been implemented to
        perform the correlation and clustering analysis of
        transcriptomic data profiled by microarray and RNA-Seq
        technologies. Additionally, this package can be further applied
        to construct gene co-expression networks (GCNs).
