Description: polysat is a collection of tools to handle microsatellite
        data of any ploidy (and samples of mixed ploidy) where allele
        copy number is not known in partially heterozygous genotypes.
        It can import and export data in ABI GeneMapper, Structure,
        ATetra, Tetrasat/Tetra, GenoDive, SPAGeDi, POPDIST, and binary
        presence/absence formats.  It can calculate pairwise distances
        between individuals using a stepwise mutation model or infinite
        alleles model. It can assist the user in estimating the ploidy
        of samples, and lastly it can estimate allele frequencies in
        populations, calculate pairwise Fst values based on those
        frequencies, and export allele frequencies to SPAGeDi and
        adegenet.
