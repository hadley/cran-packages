Description: Distance-based parametric bootstrap tests for clustering, 
  mainly intended for presence-absence data and abundance data 
  (clustering of species
  distribution ranges). Jaccard, Kulczynski, quantitative Kulczynski 
  and geco distance measures, 
  clustering of presence-absence and abundance data, and nearest neighbor 
  based noise detection (R port of Byers
  and Raftery's (1998) "NNclean"). Main functions are prabtest, abundtest (for
  testing), prabclust (for clustering), prabinit (for preparing the data)
  and NNclean (for noise detection). The help-pages for prabtest, abundtest and
  prabclust contain simple standard executions. Note that the use of the 
  package mclust (called by function prabclust) is protected by a special 
  license, see http://www.stat.washington.edu/mclust/license.txt, particularly
  point 6.
