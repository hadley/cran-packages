Description: A gene set analysis function for one-sided test (OLS) and
        two-sided test (multivariate analysis of variance).  If the
        experimental conditions are equal to 2, the p-value for
        Hotelling's t^2 test is calculated.  If the experimental
        conditions are great than 2, the p-value for Wilks' Lambda is
        deterimined and post-hoc test is reported too.  Three multiple
        comparison procedures, Dunnett, Tukey, and sequential pairwise
        comparison, are implemented.  The program computes the p-values
        and FDR (false discovery rate) q-values for all gene sets.  The
        p-values for individual genes in a significant gene set are
        also listed.  MAVTgsa generates two visualization output: a
        p-value plot of gene sets (GSA plot) and a GST-plot of the
        empirical distribution function of the ranked test statistics
        of a given gene set.
