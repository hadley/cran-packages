Description: Simulate and analyse fluorescence data sets obtained from
        calcium imaging experiments in living cells (such as neurons).
        The package provide tools to estimate background-subtracted
        fluorescence transients and build meaningful confidence
        intervals on these estimations. This covers both the case of
        homogeneous background fluorescence and that of Regions Of
        Interest (ROI) displaying background inhomogeneities.
        Background-subtracted fluorescence transients can be fitted
        with monoexponential models or estimated pointwise.
