Description: A multiway method to decompose a tensor (array) of any order,
             as a generalisation of SVD also supporting non-identity metrics and penalisations.
             2-way SVD with these extensions is also available. The package includes also some other multiway
             methods: PCAn (Tucker-n) and PARAFAC/CANDECOMP with these extensions.
