Description: The purpose of this package is to factor out logic and
        math common to Item Response Theory fitting, diagnostics, and
        analysis. It is envisioned as core support code suitable for
        more specialized IRT packages to build upon. A version 1.0 will
        offer optimized, low-level functions to map parameters to
        response probabilities for a wide variety of dichotomous and
        polytomous item models.
