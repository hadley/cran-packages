Description: influence.ME provides a collection of tools for
        calculating measures of influential data for generalized mixed
        effects models. It analyses models that were estimated using
        lme4. The basic rationale behind identifying influential data
        is that when iteratively single units are omitted from the
        data, models based on these data should not produce
        substantially different estimates. To standardize the
        assessment of how influential a (single group of)
        observation(s) is, several measures of influence are common
        practice, such as DFBETAS and Cooks' Distance.  In addition, we
        provide a measure of percentage change of the fixed point
        estimates and a simple test to detect changing levels of
        significance.
