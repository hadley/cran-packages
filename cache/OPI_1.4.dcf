Description: This package contains the current version of the Open
        Perimetry Interface (OPI), for controlling visual field
        machines using R. The OPI is a standard for interfacing with
        visual field testing machines (perimeters). It specifies basic
        functions that allow many visual field tests to be constructed.
        As of October 2012 it is fully implemented on the Octopus 900
        and partially on the Heidelberg Edge Perimeter. Note to use
        these two machines you will need either the Rhep or
        OPIOctopus900 packages which require permission from the
        respective companies to obtain: see the OPI www site. It also
        has a cousin: the R package visualFields, which has tools for
        analysing and manipulating visual field data.
