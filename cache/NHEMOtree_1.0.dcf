Description: NHEMOtree performs cost-sensitive classification by
        solving the two-objective optimization problem of minimizing
        misclassification rate and minimizing total costs for
        classification. The three methods comprised in NHEMOtree are
        based on EMOAs with either tree representation or bitstring
        representation with an enclosed classification tree algorithm.
