Title: Convert labels or tables to a dendrogram
Author: Vahid PARTOVI NIA, Anthony Davison, and Arpit Chaudhary
Maintainer: Vahid PARTOVI NIA <labeltodendro@probstat.ch>
Depends: R (>= 2.8.1)
Description: The package offers a dendrogram representation of series
        of labels, this is specially needed in Markov chain Monte Carlo
        clustering. If you have a dendrogram in your mind you can
        easily put series of meaningful labels in a matrix and heights
        in a vector, then convert them to a dendrogram abject.
