Description: This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to
        both R and Python. It implements fast hierarchical clustering
        routines on a set of dissimilarities. The R interface is
        designed as a drop-in replacement for the function “hclust” in
        the “stats” package and for the “flashClust“ package. It
        provides the same functionality, with the benefit of a much
        faster implementation. The Python interface is written as a
        replacement for the “linkage” function in the
        “scipy.cluster.hierarchy” module. Again, it provides the same
        functionality as the original function but a much faster
        implementation. For information on how to install the Python
        files, see the file INSTALL in the source distribution.
