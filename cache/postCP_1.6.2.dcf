Description: The functions are used for change-point problems, after an
        initial set of change-points within the data has already been
        obtained. The function postCP obtains estimates of posterior
        probabilities of change-point and hidden states for each
        observation, and confidence intervals for the positions of the
        change-point. The function postCPsample obtains random samples
        of sets of change-points using the output of the postCP
        function. Model selection may be performed using function
        postCPmodelsel through criteria obtained from function
        postCPcrit.
