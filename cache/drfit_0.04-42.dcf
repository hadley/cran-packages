Description: drfit provides basic functions for fitting dose-response curves to
	dose-response data, calculating some (eco)toxicological parameters and
	plotting the results. Functions that are fitted are the cumulative densitiy
	function of the lognormal distribution (probit fit), of the logistic
	distribution (logit fit), of the weibull distribution (weibull fit) and
	a linear-logistic model ("linlogit" fit), derived from the latter,
	which is used to describe data showing stimulation at low doses
	(hormesis). 
	In addition, functions checking, plotting and retrieving dose-response data
	of the UFT Bremen are provided.
	I would be delighted if you would join in this effort of creating useful
	and useable tools for dealing with dose-response data from biological
	testing.
