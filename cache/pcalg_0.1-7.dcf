Title: Estimating the skeleton and equivalence class of a DAG
Description: Standard and robust estimation of the skeleton (ugraph) 
 and the equivalence class of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via the 
 PC-Algorithm. The equivalence class is represented by its (unique) 
 Completetd Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (CPDAG). Moreover, the
 function pcSelect implements variable selection techniques.
