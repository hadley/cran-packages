Description: This package contains functions for fitting simultaneous
        systems of linear and nonlinear equations using Ordinary Least
        Squares (OLS), Weighted Least Squares (WLS), Seemingly
        Unrelated Regressions (SUR), Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS),
        Weighted Two-Stage Least Squares (W2SLS), and Three-Stage Least
        Squares (3SLS).
