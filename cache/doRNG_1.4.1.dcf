Title: Generic Reproducible Parallel Backend for foreach Loops
Version: 1.4.1
Date: 2012-03-30
Author: Renaud Gaujoux
Maintainer: Renaud Gaujoux <renaud@cbio.uct.ac.za>
Description: This package provides functions to perform reproducible
        parallel foreach loops, using independent random streams as
        generated by L'Ecuyer's combined multiple-recursive generator
        [L'Ecuyer (1999)]. It enables to easily convert standard
        %dopar% loops into fully reproducible loops, independently of
        the number of workers, the task scheduling strategy, or the
        chosen parallel environment and associated foreach backend.
