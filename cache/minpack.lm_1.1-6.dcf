Description: The nls.lm function provides an R interface to lmder and
        lmdif from the MINPACK library, for solving nonlinear
        least-squares problems by a modification of the
        Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, with support for lower and upper
        parameter bounds.  The implementation can be used via nls-like
        calls using the nlsLM function.
