Description: A number of routines for personality, psychometrics and
        experimental psychology.  Functions are primarily for scale
        construction using factor analysis, cluster analysis and
        reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive
        statistics. Functions for simulating particular item and test
        structures are included. Several functions serve as a useful
        front end for structural equation modeling.  Graphical displays
        of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation
        models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions
        are written to support a book on psychometrics as well as
        publications in personality research. For more information, see
        the personality-project.org/r webpage.
