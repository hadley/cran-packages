Description: PBS Modelling provides software to facilitate the design,
  testing, and operation of computer models. It focuses particularly on
  tools that make it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical
  user interface (GUI). Although it depends heavily on the R interface
  to the Tcl/Tk package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. The
  package contains examples that illustrate models built with other R
  packages, including PBSmapping, odesolve, PBSddesolve, and BRugs. 
  It also serves as a convenient prototype for building new R packages, 
  along with instructions and batch files to facilitate that process. 
  The R directory '.../library/PBSmodelling/doc' includes a complete user 
  guide PBSmodelling-UG.pdf. To use this package effectively, 
  please consult the guide.
