Description: ape provides functions for reading, writing, plotting,
  and manipulating phylogenetic trees, analyses of comparative data
  in a phylogenetic framework, analyses of diversification and
  macroevolution, computing distances from allelic and nucleotide
  data, reading nucleotide sequences, and several tools such as
  Mantel's test, computation of minimum spanning tree, the population
  parameter theta based on various approaches, nucleotide diversity,
  generalized skyline plots, estimation of absolute evolutionary rates
  and clock-like trees using non-parametric rate smoothing and penalized
  likelihood, classifying genes in trees using the Klastorin-Misawa-Tajima
  approach. Phylogeny estimation can be done with the NJ and ML methods.
