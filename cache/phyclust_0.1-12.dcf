Description: Phylogenetic clustering (phyloclustering) is an
        evolutionary Continuous Time Markov Chain model-based approach
        to identify population structure from molecular data without
        assuming linkage equilibrium. The package phyclust (Chen 2011)
        provides a convenient implementation of phyloclustering for DNA
        and SNP data, capable of clustering individuals into
        subpopulations and identifying molecular sequences
        representative of those subpopulations. It is designed in C for
        performance, interfaced with R for visualization, and
        incorporates other popular open source programs including ms
        (Hudson 2002), seq-gen (Rambaut and Grassly 1997),
        Hap-Clustering (Tzeng 2005) and PAML baseml (Yang 1997, 2007),
        for simulating data, additional analyses, and searching the
        best tree.  See the phyclust website for more information,
        documentations and examples.
