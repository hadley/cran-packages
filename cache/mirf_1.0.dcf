Title: MULTIPLE IMPUTATION AND RANDOM FORESTS FOR UNOBSERVABLE PHASE, HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA

Description: This package applies a combination of missing haplotype imputation via the EM algorithm of Excoffier and 
	     Slatkin(1995) and modelling trait-haplotype associations via the Random Forest algorithm. The EM algorithm 
	     is implemented by the function haplo.em (of the haplo.stats package) and the Random Forest algorithm is 
             implemented by the randomForest function (of the randomForest package). This method is described in the 
             published manuscript: B.A.S. Nonyane and A.S. Foulkes (2007) Multiple imputation and random forests (MIRF) for 
             unobservable high-dimensional data. The International Journal of Biostatistics 3(1): Article 12.
