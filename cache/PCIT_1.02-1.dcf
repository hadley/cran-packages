Description: This package provides the necessary functions for
        performing the Partial Correlation coefficient with Information
        Theory (PCIT) algorithm developed by Reverter and Chan (2008).
        The PCIT algorithm identifies meaningful correlations to define
        edges in a weighted network. The algorithm can be applied to
        any correlation-based network including but not limited to gene
        co-expression networks.
