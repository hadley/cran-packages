Title: Likelihood Analysis of Speciation/Extinction Rates from Phylogenies

Description: laser implements maximum likelihood methods based on the birth-death
	process to test whether diversification rates have changed over time.  The package 
	permits batch processing of phylogenies to generate null distributions of test statistics
	and posterior distributions of parameter estimates.  Additional functions for manipulating 
	branching times from molecular phylogenies and for simulating branching times under constant-rate models
	of diversification are provided.
