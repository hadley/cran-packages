Description: Psychometric mixture models based on flexmix
        infrastructure. At the moment Rasch mixture models with
        different parametrizations of the score distribution (saturated
        vs. mean/variance specification) and Bradley-Terry mixture
        models are implemented. Both mixture models can be estimated
        with or without concomitant variables. See vignette("raschmix",
        package = "psychomix") for details on the Rasch mixture models.
