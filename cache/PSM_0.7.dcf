Description: This package provides functions for estimation of linear and non-linear mixed-effects models using stochastic differential equations. Moreover it provides functions for finding smoothed estimates of model states and for simulation. The package allows for any multivariate non-linear time-variant model to be specified, and it also handels multidimentional input, co-variates, missing observations and specification of dosage regimen.
