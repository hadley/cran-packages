Description: This package implements multiple similarity measures for
        DO terms and gene products. It is aiming at disease analyis for
        gene sets. Modules of a gene set could be detected and further
        multilayer annoated on DO, GO and KEGG. We also provides users
        to conduct DO enrichment analysis and basic information
        fetching for DO.
