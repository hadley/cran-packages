Description: This package performs maximum entropy density based
        dependent data bootstrap. An algorithm is provided to create a
        population of time series (ensemble) without assuming
        stationarity. The reference paper (Vinod, H.D., 2004) explains
        how the algorithm satisfies the ergodic theorem and the central
        limit theorem.
