Description: These functions were developed to support 
   functional data analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O.
   and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis.
   New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier
   versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  A manual that describes
   the use of these functions is available in this
   library. The library also contains a number of the
   data sets used in the book along with R code for the
   analyses that produced many of the figures in the book.
