Description: MorseGen is a program for generating raw data scores based
        on user-supplied summary statistics (n, mean, & standard
        deviation). Samples based on the supplied statistics are drawn
        from a normal distribution until a sample of raw scores (with
        size = n) is found that recreates the specified mean and
        standard deviation (within a tolerance of .01). Intended uses
        include recreating a set of raw data for students to analyze
        that will replicate a published study.
