Description: Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large
        datasets.  Matrix eQTL can test for association between
        genotype and gene expression using both linear regression and
        ANOVA models.  The models can include covariates to account for
        such factors as population structure, gender, and clinical
        variables.  It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or
        correlated errors, false discovery rate estimation and separate
        treatment of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs.
