Title: Methods for Temporal Disaggregation and Interpolation of Time
        Series
Author: Christoph Sax, Peter Steiner
Maintainer: Christoph Sax <c.sax@seco.admin.ch>
Description: Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate
        and interpolate a low frequency time series to a higher
        frequency series. This can be done without additional
        information or by exploiting the information contained in one
        or more indicators. All disaggregation methods ensure that
        either the sum, the average, the first or the last value of the
        resulting high frequency series is consistent with the low
        frequency series.
