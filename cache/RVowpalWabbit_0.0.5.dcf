Description: R interface to Vowpal Wabbit fast out-of-core learning
        system The Vowpal Wabbit (VW) project is a fast out-of-core
        learning system sponsored by Yahoo! Research and written by
        John Langford along with a number of contributors.
 .
 There are two ways to have a fast learning algorithm: (a) start with a
        slow algorithm and speed it up, or (b) build an intrinsically
        fast learning algorithm. This project is about approach (b),
        and it has reached a state where it may be useful to others as
        a platform for research and experimentation.
 .
 There are several optimization algorithms available with the baseline
        being sparse gradient descent (GD) on a loss function (several
        are available). The code should be easily usable. Its only
        external dependence is on the Boost library, which is often
        installed by default.
 .
 This R package does not include the distributed computing
        implementation of the cluster/ directory of the upstream
        sources.  Use of the software as a network servie is also not
        directly supported as the aim is a simpler direct call from R
        for validation and comparison.
