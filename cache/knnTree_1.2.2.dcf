Title: k-nn classification with variable selection inside leaves of a tree
Author: Sam Buttrey <buttrey@nps.navy.mil>
Maintainer: Sam Buttrey <buttrey@nps.navy.mil>
Description: Construct or predict with k-nearest-neighbor classifiers,
    using cross-validation to select k, choose variables (by forward
    or backwards selection), and choose scaling (from among no scaling,
    scaling each column by its SD, or scaling each column by its MAD).
    The finished classifier will consist of a classification tree with
    one such k-nn classifier in each leaf.
