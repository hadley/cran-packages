Description: Datasets, constants, conversion factors, utilities for
        MArine, Riverine, Estuarine, LAcustrine and Coastal science.
        The package contains among others: (1) chemical and physical
        constants and datasets, e.g. atomic weights, gas constants, the
        earths bathymetry; (2) conversion factors (e.g. gram to mol to
        liter, barometric units, temperature, salinity); (3) physical
        functions, e.g. to estimate concentrations of conservative
        substances, gas transfer and diffusion coefficients, the
        Coriolis force and gravity; (4) thermophysical properties of
        the seawater, as from the UNESCO polynomial or from the more
        recent derivation based on a Gibbs function.
