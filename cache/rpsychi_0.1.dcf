Description: The rpsychi offers a number of functions for psychiatry,
        psychiatric nursing, clinical psychology. Functions are
        primarily for statistical significance testing using published
        work. For example, you can conduct a factorial analysis of
        variance (ANOVA), which requires only the mean, standard
        deviation, and sample size for each cell, rather than the
        individual data. This package covers fundamental statistical
        tests such as t-test, chi-square test, analysis of variance,
        and multiple regression analysis. With some exceptions, you can
        obtain effect size and its confidence interval. These functions
        help you to obtain effect size from published work, and then to
        conduct a priori power analysis or meta-analysis, even if a
        researcher do not report effect size in a published work.
