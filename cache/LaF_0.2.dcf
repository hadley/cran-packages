Description: The LaF package provides methods for fast access to large
        ASCII files.  Currently the following file formats are
        supported: comma separated format (csv) and fixed width format.
        It is assumed that the files are too large to fit into memory,
        although the package can also be used to efficiently access
        files that do fit into memory. Methods are provided to access
        and process files blockwise. Furthermore, an opened file can be
        accessed as one would an ordinary data.frame. The LaF vingette
        gives an overview of the functionality provided.
