Description: THIS PACKAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. (The (in-house) APD file
        format was initially developed to store Affymetrix probe-level
        data, e.g. normalized CEL intensites.  Chip types can be added
        to APD file and similar to methods in the affxparser package,
        this package provides methods to read APDs organized by units
        (probesets).  In addition, the probe elements can be arranged
        optimally such that the elements are guaranteed to be read in
        order when, for instance, data is read unit by unit.  This
        speeds up the read substantially.  This package is supporting
        the Aroma framework and should not be used elsewhere.)
