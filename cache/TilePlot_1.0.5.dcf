Description: This package is intended for processing the output from
        functional gene tiling DNA microarray experiments. It produces
        hybridization pattern plots for each gene on the array, and
        statistics for each gene including mean probe intensity, median
        probe intensity, bright probe fraction, bright segment length
        dependent score, bright probe mean intensity, and bright probe
        median intensity. Output is generated in order of bright
        segment length dependent score in both a latex/eps format and
        tab-delimited text file. The package works in three modes:
        single array, comparison of two arrays, and comparison of two
        arrays with loess normalization.
