Title: An implementation of the Grammar of Graphics
Version: 0.8.2
Author: Hadley Wickham <h.wickham@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Hadley Wickham <h.wickham@gmail.com>
Description: An implementation of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attributes. See the ggplot2 website for more information, documentation and examples.
