Description: Simulates phased diploid DNA-strands for each pedigree
        member pedigree, either by unconditional "gene dropping" or
        conditional on a specified IBD pattern. Regions compatible with
        user-defined IBD patterns (possibly different from the
        conditional patterns) are detected and summary statics
        computed. Each meioses in the pedigree is simulated from the
        latest Decode recombination map of the human genome (Kong et
        al, 2010), and a four stranded chi squared model as the basis
        model for recombination.
