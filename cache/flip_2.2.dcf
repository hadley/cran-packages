Description: It implements many univariate and multivariate permutation
        (and rotation) tests. Allowed tests: the t one and two samples,
        ANOVA, linear models, Chi Squared test, rank tests (i.e.
        Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis), Sign test and McNemar.
        Test on Linear Models are performed also in presence of
        covariates (i.e. nuisance parameters). The permutation and the
        rotation methods to get the null distribution of the test
        statistics are available. It also implements methods for
        multiplicity control such as Westfall-Young minP procedure and
        Closed Testing (Marcus, 1976). Moreover, it allows to test for
        fixed effects in mixed effects models.
