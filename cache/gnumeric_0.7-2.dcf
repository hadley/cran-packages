Description: Read data files readable by gnumeric into R. Can read
        whole sheet or a range, from several file formats, including
        the native format of gnumeric. Reading is done by using
        ssconvert (a file converter utility included in the gnumeric
        distribution http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/) to convert
        the requested part to CSV. From gnumeric files (but not other
        formats) can list sheet names and sheet sizes or read all
        sheets.
