Description: Functional gradient descent algorithm (boosting) for
        optimizing general risk functions utilizing component-wise
        (penalised) least squares estimates or regression trees as
        base-learners for fitting generalized linear, additive and
        interaction models to potentially high-dimensional data.
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), methods, stats
Imports: Matrix, survival, splines, lattice
Suggests: multicore, party (>= 0.9-9993), ipred, MASS, gbm
