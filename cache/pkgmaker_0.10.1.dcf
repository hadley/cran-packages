Description: This package provides some low-level utilities to use for
        package development. It currently provides managers for
        multiple package specific options and registries, vignette,
        unit test and bibtex related utilities.  It serves as a base
        package for packages like NMF, RcppOctave, doRNG, and as an
        incubator package for other general purposes utilities, that
        will eventually be packaged separately.  It is still under
        heavy development and changes in the interface(s) are more than
        likely to happen.
