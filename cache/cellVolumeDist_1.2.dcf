Description: This package implements a methodology for using cell
        volume distributions to estimate cell growth rates and division
        times that is described in the paper entitled "Cell Volume
        Distributions Reveal Cell Growth Rates and Division Times", by
        Michael Halter, John T. Elliott, Joseph B. Hubbard, Alessandro
        Tona and Anne L. Plant, which is in press in the Journal of
        Theoretical Biology.  In order to reproduce the analysis used
        to obtain Table 1 in the paper, execute the command
        "example(fitVolDist)".
