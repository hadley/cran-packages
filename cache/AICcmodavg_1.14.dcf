Description: This package includes functions to create model selection
        tables based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and the
        second-order AIC (AICc), as well as their quasi-likelihood
        counterparts (QAIC, QAICc).  Tables are printed with delta AIC
        and Akaike weights.  The package also includes functions to
        conduct model averaging (multimodel inference) for a given
        parameter of interest or predicted values.  Other handy
        functions enable the computation of relative variable
        importance, evidence ratios, and confidence sets for the best
        model.  The present version works with linear models ('lm'
        class), generalized linear models ('glm' class), linear models
        fit by generalized least squares ('gls' class), linear mixed
        models ('lme' class), generalized linear mixed models ('mer'
        class), multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions
        ('multinom' and 'polr' classes).
