Description: Set up matched case-pseudo controls genotypes data for
        trios in order to run trio logic regreesion, to impute missing
        genotypes in trios, or to simulate case-parent trios with
        disease risk dependent on SNP-SNP interaction. This package
        furthermore contains functions for computing the values of
        pairwise LD measures and for identifying LD blocks.
