Description: nlmrt provides tools for working with nonlinear least
        squares problems using a calling structure similar to, but much
        simpler than, that of the nls() function. Moreover, where nls()
        specifically does NOT deal with small or zero residual
        problems, nlmrt is quite happy to solve them. It also attempts
        to be more robust in finding solutions, thereby avoiding
        'singular gradient' messages that arise in the Gauss-Newton
        method within nls(). The Marquardt-Nash approach in nlmrt
        generally works more reliably to get a solution, though this
        may be one of a set of possibilities, and may also be
        statistically unsatisfactory.  Added print and summary as of
        August 28, 2012.
