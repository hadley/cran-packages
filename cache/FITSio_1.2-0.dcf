Description: Utilities to read and write files in the FITS (Flexible
        Image Transport System) format, a standard format in astronomy.
        Present low-level routines allow: * Reading and parsing FITS
        headers * Reading FITS images (multi-dimensional arrays) *
        Reading FITS binary tables * Writing FITS images
        (multi-dimensional arrays) Higher-level functions allow: *
        Reading files composed of one or more headers and a single
        (perhaps multidimensional) image or single bintable * Reading
        bintables into data frames * Generating vectors for image array
        axes * Scaling and writing images as 16-bit integers Known
        incompletenesses are reading FITS ASCII table and random group
        extensions, as well as bit, complex, and array descriptor data
        types in binary tables.
