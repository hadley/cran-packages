Description: This package fits normal mixture models to data and uses
        them to compute effect size estimates and local and tail area
        false discovery rates. To make this precise, suppose you have
        many normally distributed z's, and each z[i] has mean delta[i].
        This package will estimate delta[i] based on the z's (effect
        sizes), P(delta[i]=0|z[i]) (local false discovery rates) and
        P(delta[i]=0||z[i]|>z) (tail area false discovery rates).
