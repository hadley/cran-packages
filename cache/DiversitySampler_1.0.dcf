Description: There are two functions in this package, which can be used
        together to estimate the Shannon's Diversity index at different
        levels of sample size. A Monte-Carlo procedure is used to
        re-sample a given observation at each level of sampling. The
        expectation being that the mean of the re-sampling will
        approach Shannon's diversity index at that sample level.
