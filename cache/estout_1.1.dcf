Description: This package is intended to speedup the process of
        creating model-comparing tables common in Macroeconomics. The
        function collection stores the estimates of several models and
        formats it to a table of the form estimate starred and std.err.
        below. The default output is LaTeX but output to CSV for later
        editing in a spreadsheet tool is possible as well. It works for
        linear models (lm) and panel models from the "plm"-package
        (plm). Two further implemented functions "descsto" and
        "desctab" enable you to export descriptive statistics of
        data-frames and single variables to LaTeX and CSV.
