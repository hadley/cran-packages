Description: This package calculates the Confidence Interval (CI) for
        single binomial proportion, CI for difference of two binomial
        proportions, and CI for difference of difference.  There are 4
        major functions available: singleCI(k,n) gives the CI for
        binomial proportion given (k,n), pdiff(k1,n1,k2,n2, d) gives
        the probability that the difference of p1 from p2 is greater
        than d, and pdiffCI(k1,n1, k2,n2) gives the CI for difference
        of two binomial proportions given (k1,n1, k2, n2).
        numCI(k1,n1, k2,n2, K1, N1,K2,N2) gives the CI for difference
        of difference (p1-p2) - (P1-P2).  At default, a uniform priori
        distribution of p is assumed.  You may also specify the priori
        distribution parameter a0, b0 by assuming p follows a
        nonuniform beta distribution beta(a0, b0).  Note that boost
        header files are needed to build the package.
