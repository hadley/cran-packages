Description: rPlant is an R interface to the the many computational
        resources iPlant offers through their RESTful application
        programming interface. Currently, rPlant functions interact
        with the iPlant foundational API, the Taxonomic Name Resolution
        Service API, and the Phylotastic Taxosaurus API. Before using
        rPlant, users will have to register with the iPlant
        Collaborative.
