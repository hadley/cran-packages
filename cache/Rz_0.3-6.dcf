Description: R is very powerfull but not enough for social science
        becouse of lack in some functionality for managing survey data
        SPSS or Stata provides.  Memisc package supplements these,
        variable labels, value labels, definable missing values and so
        on, but to efficiently work these functions need graphical
        interface to overlook data. This package provides such
        graphical interface similar to SPSS's Variable View and data
        managing system using memisc package as backend. Additionally,
        Rz has powerful plot assistant interface based on ggplot2.
