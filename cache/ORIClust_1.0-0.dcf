Description: ORIClust is a user-friendly R-based software package for
        gene clustering. Clusters are given by genes matched to
        prespecified profiles across various ordered treatment groups.
        It is particularly useful for analyzing data obtained from
        short time-course or dose-response microarray experiments.
