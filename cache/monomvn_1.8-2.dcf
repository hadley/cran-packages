Description: Estimation of multivariate normal and student-t data of
        arbitrary dimension where the pattern of missing data is
        monotone. Through the use of parsimonious/shrinkage regressions
        (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge, etc.), where standard regressions
        fail, the package can handle a nearly arbitrary amount of
        missing data. The current version supports maximum likelihood
        inference and a full Bayesian approach employing scale-mixtures
        for the lasso (double-exponential) and Normal-Gamma priors, and
        Student-t errors.  Monotone data augmentation extends this
        Bayesian approach to arbitrary missingness patterns. A fully
        functional standalone interface to the Bayesian lasso (from
        Park & Casella), Normal-Gamma (from Griffin & Brown), and ridge
        regression with model selection via Reversible Jump, and
        student-t errors (from Geweke) is also provided
