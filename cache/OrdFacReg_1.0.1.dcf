Description: In biomedical studies, researchers are often interested in
        assessing the association between one or more ordinal
        explanatory variables and an outcome variable, at the same time
        adjusting for covariates of any type. The outcome variable may
        be continuous, binary, or represent censored survival times. In
        the absence of a precise knowledge of the response function,
        using monotonicity constraints on the ordinal variables
        improves efficiency in estimating parameters, especially when
        sample sizes are small. This package implements an active set
        algorithm that efficiently computes such estimators.
