Description: This package will create sophisticated models of training
        data and validate the models with an independent test set,
        cross validation, or in the case of Random Forest Models, with
        Out Of Bag (OOB) predictions on the training data. It will
        create graphs and tables of the model validation results. It
        will apply these models to GIS .img files of predictors to
        create detailed prediction surfaces. It will handle large
        predictor files for map making, by reading in the .img files in
        chunks, and output to the .txt file the prediction for each
        data chunk, before reading the next chunk of data.
