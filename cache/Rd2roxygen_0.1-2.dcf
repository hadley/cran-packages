Description: Functions to convert Rd to roxygen documentation. It can
        parse an Rd file to a list, create the roxygen documentation
        and update the original R script (e.g. the one containing the
        definition of the function) accordingly. This package also
        provides utilities which can help developers build packages
        using roxygen more easily.
