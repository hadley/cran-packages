Description: This package enables researchers to calculate power for
        cluster-randomized crossover trials by employing a
        simulation-based approach.  A particular study design is
        specified, with fixed sample sizes for all clusters and an
        assumed treatment effect, and the empirical power for that
        study design is calculated by simulating hypothetical datasets.
