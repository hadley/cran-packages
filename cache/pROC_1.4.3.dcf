Description: Tools for visualizing, smoothing and comparing receiver
        operating characteristic (ROC curves). (Partial) area under the
        curve (AUC) can be compared with statistical tests based on
        U-statistics or bootstrap. Confidence intervals can be computed
        for (p)AUC or ROC curves.

        Colin B. Begg for their support in the implementation of their
        test.
