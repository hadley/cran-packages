Description: The metafor package consists of a collection of functions
        for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package includes
        functions to calculate various effect size or outcome measures,
        fit fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such data,
        carry out moderator and meta-regression analyses, and create
        various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest, funnel,
        radial, and L'Abbe plots). For meta-analyses of 2x2 table data,
        the Mantel-Haenszel and Peto's method are also implemented.
