Title: General-purpose unconstrained non-linear optimization
Author: Hans Bruun Nielsen and Stig Bousgaard Mortensen
Maintainer: Stig Bousgaard Mortensen <stigbm@gmail.com>
Description: An algorithm for general-purpose unconstrained non-linear
        optimization. The algorithm is of quasi-Newton type with BFGS
        updating of the inverse Hessian and soft line search with a
        trust region type monitoring of the input to the line search
        algorithm. The interface of 'ucminf' is designed for easy
        interchange with 'optim'.
