Description: Bayesian network structure learning (via constraint-based,
        score-based and hybrid algorithms), parameter learning (via ML
        and Bayesian estimators) and inference. This package implements
        the Grow-Shrink (GS) algorithm, the Incremental Association
        (IAMB) algorithm, the Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB) algorithm,
        the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the Max-Min Parents and
        Children (MMPC) algorithm, the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search
        algorithm, the Tabu Search (TABU) algorithm, the Max-Min
        Hill-Climbing (MMHC) algorithm and the two-stage Restricted
        Maximization (RSMAX2) algorithm for both discrete and Gaussian
        networks, along with many score functions and conditional
        independence tests. Some utility functions (model comparison
        and manipulation, random data generation, arc orientation
        testing, simple and advanced plots) are included, as well as
        support for parameter estimation and inference, conditional
        probability queries and cross-validation.
