Package: TSsql
Version: 2013.9-1
Title: Generic SQL helper functions for TSdbi SQL plugins
Description: This package provides standard SQL query functions used by 
	SQL plugins packages for the TSdbi interface to time series databases. 
	It will mainly be used by other packages rather than directly by end
	users. The one exception is the function TSquery which can be used to
	construct a time series from a database containing observations over
	time (e.g. balance statements for muliple years), but where the database
	is not specifically designed to store time series (as with other 
	TSdbi SQL plugin packages).
	Comprehensive examples of all the TS* packages is provided in the
	vignette Guide.pdf with the TSdata package.
