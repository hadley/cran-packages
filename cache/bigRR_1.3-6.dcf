Description: The package fits large-scale (generalized) ridge
        regression for various distributions of response. The shrinkage
        parameters (lambdas) can be pre-specified or estimated using an
        internal update routine (fitting a heteroscedastic effects
        model, or HEM). It gives possibility to shrink any subset of
        parameters in the model. It has special computational advantage
        for the cases when the number of shrinkage parameters exceeds
        the number of observations. For example, the package is very
        useful for fitting large-scale omics data, such as
        high-throughput genotype data (genomics), gene expression data
        (transcriptomics), metabolomics data, etc.
