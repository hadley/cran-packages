Description: A collection of statistical tools for objective (non-supervised) applications 
             of the Regional Frequency Analysis methods in hydrology. 
             The package refers to the index-value method and, more precisely, helps the
             hydrologist to: (1) regionalize the index-value; (2) form homogeneous regions 
             with similar growth curves; (3) fit distribution functions to the 
             empirical regional growth curves.
