Description: This package contains functions to analyze coarse data.
    Specifically, it contains functions to (1) fit parametric accelerated
    failure time models to interval-censored survival time data, and (2)
    estimate the case-fatality ratio in scenarios with under-reporting.
    This package's development was motivated by applications to infectious
    disease: in particular, problems with estimating the incubation period and
    the case fatality ratio of a given disease.  Sample data files are included
    in the package.
