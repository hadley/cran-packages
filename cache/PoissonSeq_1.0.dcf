Description: This package implements a method for normalization,
        testing, and false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing
        data. The description of the method is in Li J, Witten DM,
        Johnstone I, Tibshirani R (2011). Normalization, testing, and
        false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing data.
        Submitted. Briefly speaking, we estimate the sequencing depths
        of the experiments using a new method based on Poisson
        goodness-of-fit statistic, calculate a score statistic on the
        basis of a Poisson log-linear model, and then estimate the
        false discovery rate using a modified version of permutation
        plug-in method.
