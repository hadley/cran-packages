Description: Support software for Statistical Analysis and Data
        Display (Springer, ISBN 0-387-40270-5).  This contemporary
        presentation of statistical methods features extensive use of
        graphical displays for exploring data and for displaying the
        analysis. The authors demonstrate how to analyze data---showing
        code, graphics, and accompanying computer listings---for all the
        methods they cover. They emphasize how to construct and
        interpret graphs, discuss principles of graphical design, and
        show how accompanying traditional tabular results are used to
        confirm the visual impressions derived directly from the
        graphs. Many of the graphical formats are novel and appear
        here for the first time in print. All chapters have exercises.
