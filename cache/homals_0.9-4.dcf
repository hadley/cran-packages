Description: This package performs a homogeneity analysis, aka a multiple correspondence
  analysis, but with many additional options. Variables can be grouped into
  sets, in order to emulate regression analysis and canonical analysis. For
  each variable rank constraints on the category and quantifications (or transformations) and level constraints (which allows one to treat a variable as nominal, ordinal, or numerical) can be imposed.
