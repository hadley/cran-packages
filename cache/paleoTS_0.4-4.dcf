Description: This package facilitates analysis of paleontological
        sequences of trait values from an evolving lineage.  Functions
        are provided to fit, using maximum likelihood, evolutionary
        models including unbiased random walks, directional evolution,
        stasis, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, punctuated change, and evolutionary
        models in which traits track some measured covariate.
