Description: This package implements in C++/Rcpp various
        cladogenesis-related calculations that are slow in pure R.
        These include the calculation of the probability of various
        scenarios for the inheritance of geographic range at the
        divergence events on a phylogenetic tree, and other
        calculations necessary for models which are not continuous-time
        markov chains (CTMC), but where change instead occurs
        instantaneously at speciation events.  Typically these models
        must assess the probability of every possible combination of
        (ancestor state, left descendent state, right descendent
        state).  This means that there are up to (# of states)^3
        combinations to investigate, and in biogeographical models,
        there can easily be hundreds of states, so calculation time
        becomes an issue.  C++ implementation plus clever tricks (many
        combinations can be eliminated a priori) can greatly speed the
        computation time over naive R implementations.
