Description: Discriminant analysis and data clustering methods for high
        dimensional data, based on the assumption that high-dimensional
        data live in different subspaces with low dimensionality
        proposing a new parametrization of the Gaussian mixture model
        which combines the ideas of dimension reduction and constraints
        on the model.
