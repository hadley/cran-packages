Description: GillespieSSA provides a simple to use, intuitive, and extensible interface to several stochastic simulation algorithms for generating simulated trajectories of finite population continuous-time model. Currently it implements the Gillespie's exact stochastic simulation algorithm (Direct method) and several approximate methods (Explicit tau-leap, Binomial tau-leap, and Optimized tau-leap). The package also contains a library of template models that can easily be customized and extended.
