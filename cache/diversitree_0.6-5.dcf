Description: Contains a number of comparative phylogenetic methods,
        mostly focussing on analysing diversification and character
        evolution.  Contains implementations of BiSSE (Binary State
        Speciation and Extinction; Maddison et al. 2007: Syst. Biol.
        56: 701) and its unresolved tree extensions (FitzJohn et al.
        2009: Syst. Biol. 58: 595), MuSSE (Multiple State Speciation
        and Extinction), QuaSSE (Quantitative State Speciation and
        Extinction; FitzJohn 2010: Syst. Biol. 69: 619), and GeoSSE
        (Geographic State Speciation and Extinction; Goldberg et al.
        2011: Syst. Biol.). Other included methods include Markov
        models of discrete and continuous trait evolution and constant
        rate speciation and extinction.
