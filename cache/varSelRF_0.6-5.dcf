Title: Variable selection using random forests
Author: Ramon Diaz-Uriarte <rdiaz@ligarto.org>
Maintainer: Ramon Diaz-Uriarte <rdiaz@ligarto.org>
Depends: R (>= 2.0.0), randomForest
Suggests: snow, Rmpi
Description: Variable selection from random forests
	     using both backwards variable elimination (for the selection of
	     small sets of non-redundant variables) and selection based on the
	     importance spectrum (somewhat similar to scree plots; for the
	     selection of large, potentially highly-correlated variables). 
	     Main applications in high-dimensional data
	     (e.g., microarray data, and other genomics and proteomics
	     applications). You can use rpvm instead of Rmpi if you want
	     but I've only tested with Rmpi.
