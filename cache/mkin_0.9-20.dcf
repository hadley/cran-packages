Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006).
  Includes a function for conveniently defining differential equation models,
  model solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical solvers
  and a choice of the optimisation methods made available by the FME package
  (default is a Levenberg-Marquardt variant).  Please note that no warranty is
  implied for correctness of results or fitness for a particular purpose.
Depends: FME, deSolve, minpack.lm
