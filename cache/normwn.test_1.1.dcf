Description: Includes Omnibus Univariate and Multivariate Normality
        Tests (See Doornik and Hansen (1994). One variation allows for the 	possiblity of weak dependence rather than independence in the 		variable(s). Also  included is an univariate white noise test where 	the null hypothesis is for "white noise" rather than "strict white
        noise". The package deals with similar approaches to testing as
        the "nortest","moments",and "mvnormtest" packages in R.
