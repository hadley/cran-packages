Description: The DoseFinding package provides functions for the design
        and analysis of dose-finding experiments (for example
        pharmaceutical Phase II clinical trials). It provides functions
        for: multiple contrast tests, fitting non-linear dose-response
        models, calculating optimal designs and an implementation of
        the MCPMod methodology. Currently only normally distributed
        homoscedastic endpoints are supported.
