Description: Blocks units into experimental blocks, with one unit per
        treatment condition, by creating a measure of multivariate
        distance between all possible pairs of units.  Maximum,
        minimum, or an allowable range of differences between units on
        one variable can be set.  Randomly assign units to treatment
        conditions.  Diagnose potential interference between units
        assigned to different treatment conditions.  Write outputs to
        .tex and .csv files.
