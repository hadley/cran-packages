Description: The 'abc' package provides various functions for parameter
        estimation and model selection in an ABC framework. Three main
        functions are available: (i) 'abc' implements several ABC
        inference algorithms, (ii) 'cv4abc' is a cross-validation tool
        to evaluate the quality of the estimation and help the choice
        of tolerance rate, and (iii) 'postpr' implements model
        selection in an ABC setting. All these functions are
        accompanied by appropriate summary and plotting functions.
