Description: Comprehensive implementation of Dynamic Time Warping
 algorithms in R. DTW finds the optimal (least cumulative distance)
 mapping between two time series.  All common DTW variants are
 covered, including local and global constraints, arbitrary timeseries
 lenghts, distance definitions, MVM, etc.  Package computes cumulative
 distance, warping functions, plots, normalizations, etc.
