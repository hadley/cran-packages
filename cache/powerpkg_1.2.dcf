Description: (1) To estimate the power of testing for linkage using an
  affected sib pair design, as a function of the recurrence risk ratios. We
  will use analytical power formulae as implemented in R. These are based
  on a Mathematica notebook created by Martin Farrall. (2) To examine how
  the power of the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) depends on the
  disease allele frequency, the marker allele frequency, the strength of
  the linkage disequilibrium, and the magnitude of the genetic effect. We
  will use an R program that implements the power formulae of Abel and
  Muller-Myhsok (1998). These formulae allow one to quickly compute power
  of the TDT approach under a variety of different conditions. This R
  program was modeled on Martin Farrall's Mathematica notebook.
