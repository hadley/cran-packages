Description: The Animal package is a collection of functions for
        analyzing animal (including humans) behavior data originating
        from a variety of sources. The package has functions to analyze
        time coded behaviors from CowLog (open source software for
        coding behaviors from digital video) data files and observation
        files with similar format. Other features include hourly,
        daily, weekly and monthly summaries of time coded data,
        analysis of RIC (roughage intake system, Insentec automation)
        data files and labeling measurement data according to
        behavioral observations for e.g model building purpose.
