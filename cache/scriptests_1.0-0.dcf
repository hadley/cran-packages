Description: Support for using .Rt (transcript) tests in the tests
        directory of a package.  Provides more convenience and features
        than the standard .R/.Rout.save tests.  Tests can be run under
        R CMD check and also interactively.  Provides source.pkg() for
        quickly loading code, DLLs, and data from a package for use in
        an edit/compile/test development cycle.
