Title: Estimation of CPDAG/PAG and causal inference
Description: Standard and robust estimation the equivalence class of a
        Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) via the PC-Algorithm. The
        equivalence class is represented by its (unique) Completetd
        Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (CPDAG). The function pcSelect
        implements variable selection techniques based on the
        PC-algorithm. Furthermore, a PAG instead of a CPDAG can be
        estimated if latent variables and/or selection variables are
        assumed to be present. Functions for causal inference (using
        do-calculus of Judea Pearl) are provided for CPDAGs.
