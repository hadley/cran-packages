Description: This package contains functions to classify monitor wear
        and nonwear time intervals in accelerometer data collected to
        assess physical activity in free-living condition. The package
        also contains functions to make plot for accelerometer data,
        and to obtain the summary of daily monitor wear time and the
        mean of monitor wear time during valid days. A monitored day is
        considered valid if the total minutes of classified monitor
        wear time per day is greater than a user defined cutoff.
