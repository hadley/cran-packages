Description: Calculates exact critical values to perform continuous or
        group sequential analysis for Poisson type data using the
        Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MaxSPRT) with a
        Wald type rejection boundary. Also calculates properties such
        as statistical power, expected time to signal when the null is
        rejected and maximum sample size needed to obtain a certain
        power.
