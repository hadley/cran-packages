Title: Penalized Regression with Polynomial Basis Expansions
Version: 0.1-2
Date: 2013-07-29
Author: Stephan Ritter, Alan Hubbard
Maintainer: Stephan Ritter <sritter@berkeley.edu>
Depends: glmnet, relaxnet
Suggests: genefilter, parallel
Description: Extends the glmnet and relaxnet packages with polynomial basis expansions. Basis expansion is applied to the predictors and a subset of the basis functions is chosen using relaxnet. Predictors may be screened using correlation or t-tests. Screening is done separately within cross-validation folds. Cross-validation may be used to select the order of basis expansion and alpha, the elastic net tuning parameter.
