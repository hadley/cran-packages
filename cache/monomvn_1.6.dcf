Description: Estimation of multivariate normal data of arbitrary dimension
	     where the pattern of missing data is monotone. Through the use of
	     parsimonious/shrinkage regressions (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge, 
             etc.), where standard regressions fail, the package can handle an 
             (almost) arbitrary amount of missing data.  The current version 
             supports maximum likelihood inference and implementation
             of a Bayesian version employing a Bayesian lasso.  A fully 
             functional standalone  interface to the Bayesian lasso 
             (from Park & Casella) and ridge regression with model selection 
             via Reversible Jump is also provided
Depends: R (>= 2.4), pls, lars, MASS
