Description: nloptr is an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a
        free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, providing
        a common interface for a number of different free optimization
        routines available online as well as original implementations
        of various other algorithms. See
        http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction for
        more information on the available algorithms. During
        installation on Unix the NLopt code is downloaded and compiled
        from the NLopt website.
