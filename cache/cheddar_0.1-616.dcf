Description: Cheddar provides a flexible, extendable representation of
        an ecological community and a range of functions for analysis
        and visualisation, focusing on food web, body mass and
        numerical abundance data. It also allows inter-web comparisons
        such as examining changes in community structure over
        environmental, temporal or spatial gradients.
