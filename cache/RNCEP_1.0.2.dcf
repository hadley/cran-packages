Description: This package contains functions to retrieve, organize, and
        visualize weather data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis and
        NCEP/DOE Reanalysis II datasets.  Data are queried via the
        Internet and may be obtained for a specified spatial and
        temporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time.
        We also provide functions to visualize these weather data on a
        map.
