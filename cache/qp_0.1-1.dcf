Description: the q-order partial correlation graph search algorithm, q-partial,
             or qp, algorithm for short, is a robust procedure for structure
             learning of undirected Gaussian graphical Markov models from
             "small n, large p" data, that is, multivariate normal data coming
             from a number of random variables p larger than the number of
             multidimensional data points n as in the case of, e.g., microarray
             data.
