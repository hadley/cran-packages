Description: Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and other
        distributions related to the eigenvalues of large Wishart
        matrices.
 .
 The tables for computing the Tracy-Widom densities and distribution
        functions were computed by Momar Dieng's MATLAB package
        "RMLab", which is available on his homepage at
        http://math.arizona.edu/~momar/research.htm
 .
 This package is part of a collaboration between Iain Johnstone,
        Zongming Ma, Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.  It will soon
        be replaced by a package with more accuracy and built-in
        support for relevant statistical tests.
