Description: The R package BDgraph is a statistical tool for Bayesian
        model determination in undirected Gaussian graphical models.
        The Bayesian methodology is based on birth-death MCMC
        algorithm. The main function is 'bdmcmc' which is a birth-death
        MCMC algorithm for Bayesian model determination in undirected
        Gaussian graphical models.
