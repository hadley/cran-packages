Title: Objective Bayesian Testing for the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
        Problem
Version: 1.1
Date: 2010-07-01
Description: This package implements the general (multiallelic)
        Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem from an objective Bayesian
        testing standpoint. This aim is achieved through the
        identification of a class of priors specifically designed for
        this testing problem. A class of intrinsic priors under the
        full model is considered. This class is indexed by a tuning
        quantity, the training sample size, as discussed in Consonni,
        Moreno and Venturini (2010). These priors are objective,
        satisfy Savage's continuity condition and have proved to behave
        extremely well for many statistical testing problems.
