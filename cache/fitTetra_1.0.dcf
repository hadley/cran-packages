Description: Package fitTetra contains three functions that can be used
        to assign genotypes to a collection of tetraploid samples based
        on bialleleic marker assays. Functions fitTetra (to fit several
        models for one marker from the data and select the best
        fitting) or saveMarkerModels (calls fitTetra for multiple
        markers and saves the results to files) will probably be the
        most convenient to use. Function CodomMarker offers more
        control and fits one specified model for a given marker.
