Description: Contains functions to calculate power and sample size for
             various study designs used for bioequivalence studies. 
             See function known.designs() for study designs covered. 
             Moreover the package contains functions for power and sample size 
             based on 'expected' power in case of uncertain (estimated) variability.
             -----
             Added are functions for the power and sample size for the ratio of 
             two means with normally distributed data on the original scale 
             (based on Fieller's confidence ('fiducial') interval).
             -----
             Contains further functions for power and sample size calculations
             based on non-inferiority t-test. This is not a TOST procedure but
             eventually useful if the question of 'non-superiority' must be
             evaluated.
             The power and sample size calculations based on non-inferiority
             test may also performed via 'expected' power in case of uncertain 
             (estimated) variability.
             -----
             Contains functions power.scABEL() and sampleN.scABEL() to 
             calculate power and sample size for the BE decision via scaled 
             (widened) BE acceptance limits based on simulations.
             Contains functions power.RSABE() and sampleN.RSABE() 
             to calculate power and sample size for the BE decision via  
             reference scaled ABE criterion according to the FDA procedure
             based on simulations.
             Contains further functions power.NTIDFDA() and sampleN.NTIDFDA() 
             to calculate power and sample size for the BE decision via  
             the FDA procedure for NTID's based on simulations.
