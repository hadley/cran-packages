Description: Raking a survey dataset entails re-weighting a sample by
        making the sample marginal totals agree with the population
        marginal totals for two survey response variables. Raking is a
        robust technique that is often useful for dealing with
        nonresponse. The 'rake' package streamlines the process of
        Raking by creating the special 'rake' class, which is
        essentially a summary of the sample weights.
