Description: Regularized logistic regression by Gibbs sampling. The
        package implements subtly different MCMC schemes with varying
        efficiency depending on the data type (binary v. binomial, say)
        and the desired estimator (regularized maximum likelihood, or
        Bayesian maximum a posteriori/posterior mean, etc.) through a
        unified interface
