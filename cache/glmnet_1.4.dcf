Description: Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire
        lasso or elastic-net regularization path for linear regression,
        logistic and multinomial regression models, poisson regression
        and the Cox model. The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate
        descent in a pathwise fashion, as described in the paper listed
        below.
