Description: Predict continuous valued outputs associated with text
        documents. The input corpus of text documents is transformed
        into a document-term matrix (DTM) and then a regularized linear
        regression is fit that uses this matrix as predictors to
        predict the continuous valued output. The corpus's terms,
        coefficients for all terms and an estimate of the model's
        predictive power are returned in a list.
