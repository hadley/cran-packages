Description: Sequential change detection and Phase II process control
        for univariate data streams, using the change point model
        framework. Functions are provided to allow the parametric
        monitoring of sequences of Gaussian and Bernoulli random
        variables, along with more general nonparametric functions for
        monitoring sequences which have an unspecified or unknown
        distribution.
