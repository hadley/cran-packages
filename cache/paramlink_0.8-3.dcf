Description: Parametric linkage analysis and other likelihood-based
        pedigree analyses based on the Elston-Stewart algorithm,
        including singlepoint LOD scores, power analysis and
        computation of marker genotype distributions. Multipoint
        analysis is provided through a convenient MERLIN wrapper.
        Includes many utility functions for creating, manipulating and
        plotting pedigrees, markers and linkage results.
Depends: R (>= 2.15), kinship2
SystemRequirements: For the MERLIN wrapper, MERLIN
        (www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/merlin) must be installed and
        pointed to in the PATH environment variable.
