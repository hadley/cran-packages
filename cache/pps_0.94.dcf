Description: The pps package contains functions to select samples using
        PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling. It also
        includes a function for stratified simple random sampling, a
        function to compute joint inclusion probabilities for
        Sampford's method of PPS sampling, and a few utility functions.
        The user's guide pps-ug.pdf is included.
