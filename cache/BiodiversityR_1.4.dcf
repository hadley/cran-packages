Description: This package provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface, via
        the R-Commander) and some utility functions (often based on the
        vegan package) for statistical analysis of biodiversity and
        ecological communities, including species accumulation curves,
        diversity indices, Renyi profiles, GLMs for analysis of species
        abundance and presence-absence, distance matrices, Mantel
        tests, and cluster, constrained and unconstrained ordination
        analysis. A book on biodiversity and community ecology analysis
        is available for free download from the website.
