Description: The package provides a set of functions whose aim is to
        propose 4 methods of QTL detection. HAPimLD is an
        interval-mapping method designed for unrelated individuals with
        no family information that makes use of linkage disequilibrium.
        HAPimLDL is an interval-mapping method for design of half-sib
        families. It combines linkage analysis and linkage
        disequilibrium. HaploMax is based on an analysis of variance
        with a dose haplotype effect. HaploMaxHS is based on an
        analysis of variance with a sire effect and a dose haplotype
        effect in half-sib family design.  Fundings for the package
        development were provided to the LDLmapQTL project by the ANR
        GENANIMAL program and APIS-GENE.
