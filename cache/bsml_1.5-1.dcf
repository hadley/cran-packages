Description: BSML stands for Basis Selection from Multiple Libraries
        and it is a methodology for spatially-adaptive multivariate
        regression. To fit a nonparametric or semiparametric regression
        model, multiple libraries may be used to approximate the mean
        function. The program will adaptively select basis functions
        from each library and find the optimal model complexity by
        using the Generalized Degrees of Freedom or Covariance Penalty.
