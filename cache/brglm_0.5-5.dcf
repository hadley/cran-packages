Description: Fit binomial-response GLMs using either a modified-score
        approach to bias reduction or maximum penalized likelihood
        where penalization is by Jeffreys invariant prior. Fitting
        takes place by iteratively fitting a local GLM on a pseudo-data
        representation. The interface is essentially the same as 'glm'.
        More flexibility is provided by the fact that custom
        pseudo-data representations can be specified and used for model
        fitting. Functions are provided for the construction of
        confidence intervals for the bias-reduced estimates.
