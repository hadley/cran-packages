Title: A few GPU enabled functions
Author: Josh Buckner <bucknerj@umich.edu>, Mark Seligman
        <mseligman@rapidbiologics.com>, Justin Wilson
Maintainer: Josh Buckner <bucknerj@umich.edu>
Depends: R (>= 2.8.0)
SystemRequirements: Nvidia's CUDA toolkit (>= release 2.3)
Description: This package provides R interfaces to a handful of common
        statistical algorithms. These algorithms are implemented in
        parallel using a mixture of Nvidia's CUDA langauge, Nvidia's
        CUBLAS library, and EMI Photonics' CULA libraries. On a
        computer equiped with an Nvidia GPU some of these functions may
        be substantially more efficient than native R routines. Thanks
        to Craig Stark at UC Irvine for donating time on his lab's Mac
        hardware.
