Description: "ctab" extends ftable with (multiway) percentage tables. "sqtab" contains a set of functions for estimating loglinear models for square tables such as quasi-independence, symmetry, uniform association. "mclgen" restructures a dataframe to enable the estimation of a multinomial logistic model using the conditional logit program "clogit". This allows greater flexibility in imposing constraints on the response variable. One application is to specify aforementioned models for square tables as multinomial logistic models with covariates at the respondent level.
