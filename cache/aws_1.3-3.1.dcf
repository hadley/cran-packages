Title: Adaptive Weights Smoothing
Author: Joerg Polzehl <polzehl@wias-berlin.de>
Maintainer: Joerg Polzehl <polzehl@wias-berlin.de>
Description: The library contains R-functions to perform the 
     adaptive weights smoothing (AWS) procedure described in 
     Polzehl und Spokoiny (2000), Adaptive weights smoothing with 
     applications to image restoration. Journal of the Royal Statistical    
     Society, Ser. B,  62, 2, 335--354 
     and its generalizations to local polynomial models as
     described in Polzehl und Spokoiny (2003), Varying coefficient regression 
     modeling by adaptive weights smoothing, WIAS-Preprint 818
     and to local likelihood models as described in Polzehl und Spokoiny (2002). 
     Local likelihood modelling by adaptive weights smoothing, WIAS-Preprint 787. 
     The functions awsuni, awsbi and awstri are superseded by functions aws and laws
     and will be removed in later versions.
