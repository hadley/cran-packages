Description: One of the aims of this package is to make life easier for useRs
  who deal with survey data sets. It provides an infrastructure for the management of
  survey data including value labels, definable missing values, recoding of variables,
  production of code books, and import of (subsets of) SPSS and Stata files.
  Further, it provides functionality to produce tables and data frames of
  arbitrary descriptive statistics and (almost) publication-ready tables
  of regression model estimates. Also some convenience tools for
  graphics, programming, and simulation are provided.
