Description: This package contains the functions that can be used to
        analyze the PamChip microarray data. The package is mainly
        useful in fitting semi-parametric mixed effects models while
        accommodating various types of mean structures and correlation
        structures present in Kinase activity profiling experiments.
        The package can be used to visualize, cleaning Pam Chip data.
        And also it can be used in model fitting, velocity estimating,
        and testing the estimated velocities between the groups. The
        PamGeneMixed package is built up as a software implementation
        for the paper titled The Use of Semi-parametric Mixed Models to
        Analyze PamChip Peptide Array Data: an Application to an
        Oncology Experiment which is published in Bioinformatics
        (2011).
