Author: Simon Urbanek <Simon.Urbanek@r-project.org>
Maintainer: Simon Urbanek <Simon.Urbanek@r-project.org>
Depends: R (>= 1.5.0)
SystemRequirements: R must be compiled with --enable-R-shlib if the
        server is to be built
Description: Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets)
        which allows binary requests to be sent to R. Every connection
        has a separate workspace and working directory. Client-side
        implementations are available for popular languages such as
        C/C++ and Java, allowing any application to use facilities of R
        without the need of linking to R code. Rserve supports remote
        connection, user authentication and file transfer. A simple R
        client is included in this package as well.
