Description: This package implements propensity clustering and
        decomposition. Propensity decomposition can be viewed on the
        one hand as a generalization of the eigenvector-based
        approximation of correlation networks, and on the other hand as
        a generalization of random multigraph models and
        conformity-based decompositions.
