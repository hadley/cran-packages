Description: In the new era of population genomics, surveys of genetic
        polymorphism ("genome scans") offer the opportunity to
        distinguish locus-specific from genome wide effects at many
        loci. Identifying presumably neutral regions of the genome that
        are assumed to be influenced by genome-wide effects only, and
        excluding presumably selected regions, is therefore critical to
        infer population demography and phylogenetic history reliably.
        Conversely, detecting locus-specific effects may help identify
        those genes that have been, or still are, targeted by natural
        selection. The software package DetSel has been developed to
        identify markers that show deviation from neutral expectation
        in pairwise comparisons of diverging populations.
