Description: The RQuantLib package makes selected parts of QuantLib 
	visible to the R user. Currently some basic option pricing 
	functions are included, as well as fixed-income functions that 
	can be used for interest rate curve construction and Bermuda 
	swaption pricing. Further software contributions are welcome.
	.
	The QuantLib project aims to provide a comprehensive software 
	framework for quantitative finance. The goal is to provide a 
	standard open source library for quantitative analysis,
	modeling, trading, and risk management of financial
	assets.
	.
	The Windows binary version is self-contained and does not require 
	a QuantLib (or Boost) installation. QuantLib and Boost libraries 
	and header files are needed to build RQuantLib from source.
	.
	Parts of RQuantLib use the Rcpp R/C++ interface class library.
	See the RcppTemplate package on CRAN for more information on Rcpp.
Depends: R (>= 2.3.1)
SystemRequirements: QuantLib library from http://quantlib.org, Boost library
	from http://www.boost.org
License: GPL Version 2 or later for RQuantLib; QuantLib itself is released
	under an Open Source license as well (see QuantLib-License.txt).
