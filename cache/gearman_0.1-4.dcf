Description: gearman provides a reference class interface to the
        Gearman Job server. gearman links to the libgearman C library
        and currently exposes the client API, allowing R users to
        submit jobs to Gearman Job servers. A future version may expose
        the worker API, thus allowing users to place R jobs within the
        server... callable by any gearman-enabled client.
