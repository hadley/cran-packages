Description: This package can be used to assess cryptographic
        properties of Boolean functions such as nonlinearity, algebraic
        immunity, resiliency, etc... It also implements functionality
        to handle Boolean polynomials, namely multiplication and
        addition of multivariate polynomials with coefficients and
        exponents in {0,1}.
