Description: Two functions, sdt and mlmsdt, for calculating statistics
    from signal detection theory. sdt calculates several measures where each
    individual's data form a 2x2 table. Statistics for each individual and for
    the sample are calculated. mlmsdt using Bates' (2008) lme4 to run multilevel
    generalized linear models for this situation. Deatails in Wright, D.B., 
    Horry, R., & Skagerberg, E.M. (in press). Functions for traditional and 
    multilevel approaches to signal detection theory. Behavior Research Methods.
