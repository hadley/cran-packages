Description: A number of routines for personality, psychometrics and
        experimental psychology.  Functions are primarily for scale
        construction using factor analysis, cluster analysis and
        reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive
        statistics. Functions for simulating particular item and test
        structures are included. Several functions serve as a useful
        front end for structural equation modeling.  For more
        information, see the personality-project.org/r webpage.
