Maintainer: Doug Nychka <nychka@ucar.edu>
Description: Fixed rank Kriging for large data sets that supports a
        large number of basis functions and provides spatial estimates
        that are comparable to standard families of covariance
        functions and estimates that are close to interpolating the
        observations (a small nugget variance.)
