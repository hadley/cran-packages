Description: R package for design of experiments for design of
        genome-wide association studies.  Version 2 incorporating
        quantitative traits and case-control studies. The Bayes factor
        should be chosen large enough to give respectable posterior
        odds. This requires Bayes factors of the order of 10^6 in
        genome-wide association studies where prior odds are low.
        Sample sizes needed to get this strength of evidence are
        substantially higher than those from traditional power
        calculations. The corresponding threshold for p-values is
        substantially lower than commonly used.  For quantitative
        traits ldDesign uses an existing deterministic power
        calculation for detection of linkage disequilibrium between a
        bi-allelic QTL and a bi-allelic marker, together with the
        Spiegelhalter and Smith Bayes factor to generate designs with
        power to detect effects with a given Bayes factor. For case-
        control studies an asymptotic approximate Bayes factor is used
        to derive an analytical power calculation in dominant,
        recessive, additive and general genetic models.
