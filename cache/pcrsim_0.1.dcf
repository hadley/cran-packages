Description: pcrsim is a package for simulating the forensic DNA
        process. pcrsim() opens up a graphical user interface which
        allow the user to enter parameters required for the simulation.
        Once calibrated the program can be used to: reduce the
        laboratory work needed for validation of new STR kits, help
        develop methods for interpretation of DNA evidence, etc.  This
        is a first version which is still experimental and under
        development.
