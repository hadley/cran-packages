Title: Ridge regression and other kernels for genomic selection
Version: 3.2

Maintainer: Jeffrey Endelman <j.endelman@gmail.com>
Description: One application is to estimate marker effects by ridge
        regression; alternatively, BLUPs can be calculated based on
        kinship.  The genetic covariance between lines can be modeled
        using a marker-based, additive relationship matrix, or via
        Gaussian and exponential kernels.
