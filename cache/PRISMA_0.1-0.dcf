Description: The PRISMA package is capable of loading and processing
        huge text corpora processed with the sally toolbox
        (http://www.mlsec.org/sally/). sally acts as a ver fast
        preprocessor which splits the text files into tokens or
        n-grams. These output files can then be read with the PRISMA
        package which applies testing-based token selection and has
        some duplicat-aware, highly tuned Non-Negative Matrix
        Factorzation and Principal component Analysis implementation
        which allows the processing of very big data sets even on
        desktop machines.
