Description: This package analyses complex ANOVA models with any
        combination of orthogonal/nested and fixed/random factors, as
        described by Underwood (1997). There are two restrictions: (i)
        data must be balanced; (ii) fixed nested factors are not
        allowed. Homogeneity of variances is checked using Cochran's C
        test and "a posteriori" comparisons of means are done using
        Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) procedure.
