Description: list is a publicly available R package that allows
        researchers to conduct multivariate statistical analyses of
        survey data with list experiments. In addition, the package
        implements the statistical test that is designed to detect
        certain failures of list experiments. This survey methodology
        is also known as the item count technique or the unmatched
        count technique and is an alternative to the commonly used
        randomized response method. The package implements the methods
        developed by Imai (2010) and Blair and Imai (2010), and a
        Bayesian MCMC implementation of regression for the standard and
        multiple sensitive item list experiment designs.
