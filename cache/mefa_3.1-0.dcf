Description: A framework package aimed to provide standardized
        computational environment for specialist work via object
        classes to represent the data coded by samples, taxa and
        segments (i.e. subpopulations, repeated measures). It supports
        easy processing of the data along with cross tabulation and
        relational data tables for samples and taxa. An object of class
        `mefa' is a project specific compendium of the data and can be
        easily used in further analyses. Methods are provided for
        extraction, aggregation, conversion, plotting, summary and
        reporting of `mefa' objects. Reports can be generated in plain
        text or LaTeX format. Vignette contains worked examples.
