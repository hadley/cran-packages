Title: Gifi Methods for Optimal Scaling
Version: 1.0-3
Date: 2010-08-24
Author: Jan de Leeuw, Patrick Mair
Maintainer: Jan de Leeuw <deleeuw@ucla.edu>
Description: This package performs a homogeneity analysis and various
        extensions. Rank restrictions on the category quantifications
        can be imposed (nonlinear PCA). The categories are transformed
        by means of optimal scaling with options for nominal, ordinal,
        and numerical scale levels (for rank-1 restrictions). Variables
        can be grouped into sets, in order to emulate regression
        analysis and canonical correlation analysis.
