Description: The package includes methods for imputation of
        compositional data including robust methods, methods to impute
        rounded zeros, (robust) outlier detection for compositional
        data, (robust) principal component analysis for compositional
        data, (robust) factor analysis for compositional data, (robust)
        discriminant analysis for compositional data (Fisher rule),
        robust regression with compositional predictors and (robust)
        Anderson-Darling normality tests for compositional data as well
        as popular log-ratio transformations (alr, clr, ilr, and their
        inverse transformations).  In addition, visualisation and
        diagnostic tools are implemented as well as high and low-level
        plot functions for the ternary diagram.
