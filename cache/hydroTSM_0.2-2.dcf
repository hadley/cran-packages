Description: S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and
        plot of hydrological time series, mainly oriented to
        hydrological modelling tasks. So far, it only works with daily
        / monthly / seasonal / annual time series. The focus of this
        package has been put in providing a collection of tools useful
        for the daily work of hydrologists (although an effort was made
        to optimize each function as much as possible, functionality
        has had priority over speed). Bugs / comments / questions /
        collaboration of any kind are very welcomed, and in particular,
        datasets that can be included in this package for academic
        purposes.
