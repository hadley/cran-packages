Description: This package computes the correlation matrix for each
        scale of a wavelet decomposition, namely the one performed by
        the R package waveslim (Whitcher, 2000). An hypothesis test is
        applied to each entry of one matrix in order to construct an
        adjacency matrix of a graph. The graph obtained is finally
        analysed using the small-world theory (Watts and Strogatz,
        1998) and using the computation of efficiency (Latora, 2001),
        tested using simulated attacks. The brainwaver project is
        complementary to the camba project for brain-data
        preprocessing. A collection of scripts (with a makefile) is
        avalaible to download along with the brainwaver package, see
        information on the webpage mentioned below.
