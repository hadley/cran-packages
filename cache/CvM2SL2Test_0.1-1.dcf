Description: The package contains two functions: one computes the
        Cramer-von Mises two sample test scores, the other cmoputes the
        exact p-value(s) for given Cramer-von Mises two-sample test
        score(s) under the assumption that the populations under
        comparison have the same probability distribution. Like
        Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test, Cramer-von Mises test is
        also distribution free. In certain cases, the Cramer-von Mises
        test is more powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, but it
        is less widely used than the latter.
