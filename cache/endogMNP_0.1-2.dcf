Description: endogMNP is an R package that fits a Bayesian multinomial
        probit model with endogenous selection, which is sometimes
        called an endogenous switching model.  This can be used to
        model discrete choice data when respondents select themselves
        into one of several groups.  This package is based on the MNP
        package by Kosuke Imai and David A. van Dyk.  This package
        modifies their code.
