Description: Conjoint measurement is a psychophysical procedure in
        which stimulus pairs are presented that vary along 2 or more
        dimensions and the observer is required to compare the stimuli
        along one of them.  This package contains functions to estimate
        the contribution of the n scales to the judgment by a maximum
        likelihood method under several hypotheses of how the
        perceptual dimensions interact.
