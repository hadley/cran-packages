Description: This package is a toolbox for sequence manipulation,
        description, rendering and more generally sequence data mining
        in the field of social sciences. Though it is primarily
        intended for analyzing state or event sequences that describe
        life courses such as family formation histories or professional
        careers its features apply indeed also to many other kinds of
        categorical sequence data. It accepts as input many different
        sequence representations and provides tools for translating
        sequences from one format to another. It offers several
        statistical functions for describing and rendering sequences,
        for computing distances between sequences with different
        metrics among which optimal matching, the longest common prefix
        and the longest common subsequence, and simple functions for
        extracting the most frequent subsequences and identifying the
        most discriminating ones among them. A user's guide can be
        found on TraMineR's web page.
