Description: A multiway method to decompose a tensor (array) of any
        order, as a generalisation of SVD also supporting non-identity
        metrics and penalisations. 2-way SVD with these extensions is
        also available. The package includes also some other multiway
        methods: PCAn (Tucker-n) and PARAFAC/CANDECOMP with these
        extensions.
