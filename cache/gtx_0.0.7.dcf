Description: Assorted tools for genetic association analyses.  The
        current focus is on implementing (either exactly or
        approximately) regression analyses using summary statistics
        instead of using subject-specific data.  So far, functions
        exist to support multi-SNP risk score analyses, multi-SNP
        conditional regression analyses, and multi-phenotype analyses,
        using summary statistics.  There are helper functions for
        reading and manipulating subject-specific genotype data, which
        provide a platform for calculating the summary statistics, or
        for using R to conduct other analyses not supported by specific
        GWAS analysis tools.
