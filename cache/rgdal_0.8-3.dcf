Package: rgdal
Title: Bindings for the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library
Version: 0.8-3
Date: 2013-01-06
Depends: R (>= 2.13.0), methods, sp (>= 1.0-4)
LinkingTo: sp
Description: Provides bindings to Frank Warmerdam's Geospatial Data
        Abstraction Library (GDAL) (>= 1.7.1) and access to
        projection/transformation operations from the PROJ.4 library.
        The GDAL and PROJ.4 libraries are external to the package, and,
        when installing the package from source, must be correctly
        installed first. Both GDAL raster and OGR vector map data can
        be imported into R, and GDAL raster data and OGR vector data
        exported. Use is made of classes defined in the sp package.
        Windows and Mac Intel OS X binaries (including GDAL, PROJ.4 and
        Expat) are provided on CRAN.
