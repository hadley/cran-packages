Description: This package provides methods and examples to support a
        method of Gene Set Functional Enrichment Analysis (GSFEA).
        DBGSA is a novel distance-based gene set enrichment analysis
        method. We consider that, the distance between 2 groups with
        different phenotype by focusing on the gene expression should
        be larger, if a certain gene functional set was significantly
        associated with a particular phenotype.
