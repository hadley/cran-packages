Description: This package proposes a model-based clustering algorithm for
    ranking data. Multivariate rankings as well as partial rankings are taken
    into account. This algorithm is based on an extension of the Insertion
    Sorting Rank (ISR) model for ranking data, which is a meaningful and
    effective model parametrized by a position parameter (the modal ranking,
    quoted by mu) and a dispersion parameter (quoted by pi). The heterogeneity
    of the rank population is modelled by a mixture of ISR, whereas conditional
    independence assumption is considered for multivariate rankings.
