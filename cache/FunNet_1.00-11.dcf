Description: FunNet is an integrative tool for analyzing gene
        co-expression networks built from microarray expression data.
        The analytic model implemented in this library involves two
        abstraction layers: transcriptional and functional (biological
        roles). A functional profiling technique using Gene Ontology &
        KEGG annotations is applied to extract a list of relevant
        biological themes from microarray expression profiling data.
        Afterwards multiple-instance representations are built to
        relate significant themes to their transcriptional instances
        (i.e. the two layers of the model). An adapted non-linear
        dynamical system model is used to quantify the proximity of
        relevant genomic themes based on the similarity of the
        expression profiles of their gene instances. Eventually an
        unsupervised multiple-instance clustering procedure, relying on
        the two abstraction layers, is used to identify the structure
        of the co-expression network composed from modules of
        functionally related transcripts. Functional and
        transcriptional maps of the co-expression network are provided
        separately together with detailed information on the network
        centrality of related transcripts and genomic themes.
