Description: Frailtypack now fits several classes of frailty models
        using Penalized Likelihood on the hazard function. 1) A shared
        gamma frailty model and Cox proportional hazards model. Left
        truncated, censored data and strata (max=2) are allowed.
        Clustered and recurrent survival times can be studied (the
        Andersen-Gill(1982) approach has been implemented for recurrent
        events). An automatic choice of the smoothing parameter is
        possible using an approximated cross-validation procedure. 2)
        Additive frailty models for proportional hazards models with
        two correlated random effects (intercept random effect with
        random slope). 3) Nested frailty models for hierarchically
        clustered data (with 2 levels of clustering) by including two
        iid gamma random effects. 4) Joint frailty models in the
        context of joint modelling of recurrent events with terminal
        event.
