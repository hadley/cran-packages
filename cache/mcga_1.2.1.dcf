Description: Machine Coded Genetic Algorithms (mcga) builds genetic
        algorithms with machine coded chromosomes for real value
        optimizitation problems. Chromosomes are not encoded/decoded,
        the byte representation of double values are used for the
        genetic operations such as crossing-over and mutation.
        Computers already decode and encode the variables using a
        finite set of alphabet. This makes mcga extremely fast even the
        number of parameters is high.
