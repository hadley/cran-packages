Description: MorseGen is a program for generating raw data based on
        user-specified summary (descriptive) statistics. Samples based
        on the supplied statistics are drawn from a normal distribution
        (or, in some cases, an exponential distribution) and scaled to
        match the desired descriptive statistics. Intended uses include
        creating raw data that fits desired characteristics or to
        replicate the results in a published study.
