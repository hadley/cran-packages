Description: An assortment of functions that could be useful in
        analyzing data from pyschophysical experiments. It includes
        functions for calculating d' from several different
        experimental designs, links for m-alternative forced-choice
        (mafc) data to be used with the binomial family in glm (and
        possibly other contexts) and self-Start functions for
        estimating gamma values for CRT screen calibrations.
