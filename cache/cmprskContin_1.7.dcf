Description: Estimation and testing of continuous mark-specific
        relative risks in two groups as described in Gilbert, P.,
        McKeague, I. and Sun, Y. (2008) The 2-sample problem for
        failure rates depending on a continuous mark: an application to
        vaccine efficacy. Biostatistics 9, 2, 263-276. This package
        implements the methods presented in the paper for testing
        mark-specific hazards ratios and for estimation of
        mark-specific incidence ratios that are cumulative in time or
        cumulative in both time and the continuous mark.
