Description: This R package is a wrapper around the liblinear C/C++
        library for machine learning. It allows the estimation of
        predictive linear models such as L1- or L2-regularized logistic
        regression, L1- or L2-regularized L2-loss support vector
        classification, L2-regularized L1-loss support vector
        classification and multi-class support vector classification.
        The estimation of the models is particularly fast as compared
        to other libraries. For more information on the C/C++ liblinear
        library itself, refer to R.-E. Fan, K.-W. Chang, C.-J. Hsieh,
        X.-R. Wang, and C.-J. Lin. LIBLINEAR: A Library for Large
        Linear Classification, Journal of Machine Learning Research
        9(2008), 1871-1874, available at
        http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear . The two first
        blocks of the package version indicates which version of
        liblinear is currently supported. For example: 1.32-14 means
        that the package supports the version 1.32 of liblinear.
