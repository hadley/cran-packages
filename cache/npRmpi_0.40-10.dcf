Description: This package provides a variety of nonparametric (and
        semiparametric) kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of
        continuous, unordered, and ordered factor data types. This
        package is a parallel implementation of the np package based on
        the MPI specification that incorporates the Rmpi package (Hao
        Yu <hyu@stats.uwo.ca>) with minor modifications and we are
        extremely grateful to Hao Yu for his contributions to the R
        community. We would like to gratefully acknowledge support from
