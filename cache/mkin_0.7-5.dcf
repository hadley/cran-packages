Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report
        (2006). Includes a function for conveniently defining
        differential equation models, choice of the optimisation
        methods made available by the FME package (default is a
        Levenberg-Marquardt variant). Initial values for parameters of
        the differential equations and time zero values of the state
        values can be defaults, user defined or a combination of a fit
        for the parent compound carried out by the kinfit package and
        defaults. DT50 and DT90 values are calculated as well as the
        chi2 error level as defined by the FOCUS Kinetics Group.
