Description: Lambert W random variables (RV) offer a new way of dealing
        with slightly skewed data. It is based on an input/ouput
        framework - for details see References. This package contains
        the most important functions to perform an adequate analysis.
        Lambert W data can be simulated, parameters estimated, and
        results plotted in a "nice" way.Quantile functions allow a more
        realistic analysis and inference of skewed data (see
        References).
