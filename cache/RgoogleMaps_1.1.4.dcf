Description: This package serves two purposes: (i) Provide a
        comfortable R interface to query the Google server for static
        maps, and (ii) Use the map as a background image to overlay
        plots within R. This requires proper coordinate scaling. NOTE:
        To do anything but downloading static map tiles, RgoogleMaps
        needs EITHER rgdal OR ReadImages installed ! Such an OR
        dependency is difficult to express in the Depends field, so I
        moved both packages to suggested. rgdal is your package if you
        prefer png file format and ReadImages if you prefer jpg format.
        In the latter case, you will also need the libjpeg library
        installed.
