Title: Z's ordered observations
Author: Achim Zeileis, Gabor Grothendieck
Maintainer: Achim Zeileis <Achim.Zeileis@R-project.org>
Description: An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed
        observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular time series
        of numeric vectors/matrices and factors. zoo's key design goals
        are independence of a particular index/date/time class and
        consistency with ts and base R by providing methods to extend
        standard generics.
Depends: R (>= 2.4.1), stats
Suggests: coda, chron, DAAG, fCalendar, fSeries, fts, its, lattice,
        strucchange, timeDate, timeSeries, tis, tseries, xts
Imports: stats, utils, graphics, grDevices, lattice
