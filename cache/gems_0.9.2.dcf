Description: This package allows to simulating and analyzing multistate
        models with general hazard functions. It provides functionality
        for the preparation of hazard functions and parameters,
        simulation from a general multistate model and predicting
        future events. The multistate model is not required to be a
        Markov model and may take the history of previous events into
        account. In the basic version, it allows to simulate from
        transition-specific hazard function, whose parameters are
        multivariable normally distributed.
