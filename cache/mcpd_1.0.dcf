Description: The package provides some tools for botanists,
        taxonomists, curators of plant genebanks and perhaps other
        biological collections that make use of passport data for plant
        specimens in a standard format (MCPD). Currently, the tool
        allows to create simple specimen indices as found in taxonomic
        treatments. An example Excel file is provided. Each specimen
        record must at least have content in the following fields:
        GENUS, SPECIES, collector, number, ORIGCTY (names in upper case
        correspond to fields defined in the MCPD standard.). In
        addition, records can be removed explicitly from the generated
        index putting an 'x' in the 'remove' field. Further filtering
        can be done by specifying countries in the 'countries'-sheet or
        allowing 'all'. Countries will be ordered alphabetically.
        Species can be ordered and filtered explicitly in the sheet
        'species-order'. The geographic coordinate fields 'DECLATITUDE'
        and 'DECLONGITUDE' are assumed to be decimal and in WGS84
        projection. As an output, a web page in standard html format is
        created based on a template in markdown format. The template
        may be changed and specified. The generated web-page can be
        edited in most word processing software.
