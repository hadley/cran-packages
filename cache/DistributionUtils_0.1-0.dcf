Description: This package contains utilities which are of use in the
        packages I have developed for dealing with distributions.
        Currently these packages are GeneralizedHyperbolic,
        VarianceGamma, and SkewHyperbolic. Additional packages are
        under development. Each of these packages requires
        DistributionUtils. Functionality includes sample skewness and
        kurtosis, log-histogram, moments by integration, changing the
        pint about which a moment is calculated, functions for testing
        distributions using inversion tests and the Massart inequality.
