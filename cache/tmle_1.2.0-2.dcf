Description: tmle implements targeted maximum likelihood estimation,
        first described in van der Laan and Rubin, 2006 (Targeted
        Maximum Likelihood Learning, The International Journal of
        biostatistics, 2(1), 2006.  This version adds the tmleMSM
        function to the package, for estimating the parameters of a
        marginal structural model (MSM) for a binary point treatment
        effect.  The tmle function calculates the adjusted marginal
        difference in mean outcome associated with a binary point
        treatment, for continuous or binary outcomes.  Relative risk
        and odds ratio estimates are also reported for binary outcomes.
        Missingness in the outcome is allowed, but not in treatment
        assignment or baseline covariate values. Effect estimation
        stratified by a binary mediating variable is also available.
        The population mean is calculated when there is missingness,
        and no variation in the treatment assignment.  An ID argument
        can be used to identify repeated measures. Default settings
        call SuperLearner to estimate the Q and g portions of the
        likelihood, unless values or a user-supplied regression
        function are passed in as arguments.
