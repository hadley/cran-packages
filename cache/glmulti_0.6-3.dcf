Description: Automated model selection for GLMs. Provides a wrapper for
        glm and similar functions, automatically generating all
        possible models (under constraints set by the user) with the
        specified response and explanatory variables, and finding the
        best models in terms of some Information Criterion (AIC, AICc
        or BIC). Can handle very large numbers of candidate models.
        Features a Genetic Algorithm to find the best models when an
        exhaustive screening of the candidates is not feasible.
