Description: package relax contains some functions for report writing,
        presentation, and programming: relax(), tangleR(), weaveR(),
        (g)slider(). "relax" is written in R and Tcl/Tk.  relax creates
        a new window (top level Tcl/Tk widget) that consists of two
        text fields and some buttons and menus.  Text (chunks) and code
        (chunks) are inserted in the upper text field (report field).
        Code chunks are evaluated by clicking on EvalRCode.  Results
        are shown in the lower text field (output field) and will be
        transferred to the report field by pressing on Insert.  In this
        way you get correct reports. These reports can be loaded again
        in cause of presentation, modification and result checking.
        tangleR() and weaveR() implement a plain kind of tangling and
        weaving. gslider() and slider() are designed to define sliders
        for interactive experiments in a simple way.  The syntax rules
        of code chunks and text chunks are defined by the noweb system
        proposed by Norman Ramsey
        (http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/intro.html).
