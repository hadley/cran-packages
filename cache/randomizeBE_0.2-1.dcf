Description: Contains a function to randomise subjects, patients in
        groups of sequences (treatment sequences).  If a blocksize is
        given, the randomisation will be done within blocks.  The
        randomisation may be controlled by a Wald-Wolfowitz runs test.
        The package is mainly intended for randomisation of
        bioequivalence studies but may be used also for other clinical
        crossover studies.  Contains a helper function to get the
        sequences of commonly used designs in BE studies.
