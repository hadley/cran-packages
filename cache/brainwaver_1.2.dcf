Description: This package computes the correlation matrix for each scale of a 
 wavelet decomposition, namely the one performed by the R package waveslim 
 (Whitcher, 2000). An hypothesis test is applied to each entry of one matrix 
 in order to construct  an adjacency matrix of a graph. The graph obtained is 
 finally analysed using the small-world theory (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and 
 using the computation of efficiency (Latora, 2001), tested using simulated 
 attacks. The brainwaver project is complementary to the camba project for 
 brain-data preprocessing.
