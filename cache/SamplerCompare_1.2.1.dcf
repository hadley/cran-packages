Description: This package consists of two components: a framework for
        running sets of MCMC samplers on sets of distributions with a
        variety of tuning parameters and plotting functions to
        visualize the results of those simulations.  See sc-intro.pdf
        for an introduction.  Version 1.2 adds a mechanism for loading
        external simulations.
