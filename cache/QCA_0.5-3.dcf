Description: Performs the Quine-McCluskey algorithm for Qualitative
        Comparative Analysis, as described in Ragin, Charles C. 1987
        "The Comparative Method. Moving beyond qualitative and
        quantitative strategies", Berkeley: University of California
        Press. In the classical approach it currently handles about 15
        conditions and one outcome, but since version 0.4-5 the package
        has an enhanced, faster function that obtains the same exact
        solutions with a substantially lower memory consumption, and it
        handles even more causal conditions. The next versions of this
        algorithm will be oriented towards multi-value and fuzzy-set
        functions. Also, in the near future the current functions will
        deal with missing values in the data
