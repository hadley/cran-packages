Description: Observational studies are limited in that there could be
        an unmeasured variable related to both the response variable
        and the primary predictor.  If this unmeasured variable were
        included in the analysis it would change the relationship
        (possibly changing the conclusions).  Sensitivity analysis is a
        way to see how much of a relationship needs to exist with the
        unmeasured variable before the conclusions change.  This
        package provides tools for doing a sensitivity analysis for
        regression (linear, logistic, and cox) style models.
