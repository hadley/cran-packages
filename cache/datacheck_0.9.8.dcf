Description: The package provides functionality to check variables
        against a set of basic rules. A rule file can be accompanied by
        lookup tables. In addition, the package provides some
        convenience testing functions that may serve also as an example
        for defining clearer 'data rules' or tests. An html based user
        interface facilitates initial exploration of the functionality.
