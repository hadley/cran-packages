Description: apTreeshape is mainly dedicated to simulation and analysis
        of phylogenetic tree topologies using statistical indices. It
        is a companion library of the 'ape' package. It provides
        additional functions for reading, plotting, manipulating
        phylogenetic trees. It also offers convenient web-access to
        public databases, and enables testing null models of
        macroevolution using corrected test statistics.  Trees of class
        "phylo" (from 'ape' package) can be converted easily.
