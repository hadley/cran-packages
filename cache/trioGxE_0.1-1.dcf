Description: The package contains functions that 1) estimates
        gene-environment interaction between a SNP and a continuous
        non-genetic attribute by fitting a generalized additive model
        to case-parent trio data, 2) produces graphical displays of
        estimated interaction, 3) performs permutation test of
        gene-environment interaction; 4) simulates informative
        case-parent trios.
