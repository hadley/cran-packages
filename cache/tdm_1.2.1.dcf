Description: TDM can be used to estimate individual pharmacokinetic parameters with one or more drug serum/plasma concentrations obtained from a single subject or multiple subjects using OpenBUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling) interfaced through BRugs. Besides, it also can calculate a suggested dose with the target drug concentration (C ->D) or calculate a predicted drug concentration with a given dose (D -> C).
