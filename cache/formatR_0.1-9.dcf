Title: Format R Code Automatically
Version: 0.1-9
Date: 2011-01-16
Author: Yihui Xie
Maintainer: Yihui Xie <xie@yihui.name>
Description: This package provides a function tidy.source() and
        optionally a GUI (by gWidgets and prefers gWidgetsRGtk2) to
        format R source code.  Spaces and indent will be added to the
        code automatically, and comments will be preserved under
        certain conditions, so that R code will be more human-readable
        and tidy.
