Description: Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source
        libraries.  A large part of Boost is provided as C++ template
        code which is resolved entirely at compile-time without
        linking.  This package aims to provide the most useful subset
        of Boost libraries for template use among CRAN package. By
        placing these libraries in this package, we offer a more
        efficient distribution system for CRAN as replication of this
        code in the sources of other packages is avoided.
