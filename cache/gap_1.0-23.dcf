Description: It is designed as an integrated package for genetic data
        analysis of both population and family data. Currently, it
        contains functions for sample size calculations of both
        population-based and family-based designs, classic twin models,
        probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship
        calculation, some statistics in linkage analysis, and
        association analysis involving one or more genetic markers
        including haplotype analysis with or without environmental
        covariates.
