Description: Meth27QC is a tool for analyzing Illumina Infinium
        HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Data and generating QC reports.
        This package allows users quickly assess data quality of the
        Assay. Users can evaluate the data quality in the way that
        Illumina GenomeStudio/BeadStudio recommended based on the
        control probes. The package reads files exported from
        GenomeStudio/BeadStudio software, generating intensity and
        standard deviation plots grouped by the types of the control
        probes. Meth27 carries 40 control probes for staining,
        hybridization, target removal, extension, bisulfite conversion,
        specificity, negative and non-polymorphic controls. Details of
        those control probes can be found in the Infinium Assay for
        Methylation Protocol Guide from Illumina.We also used the other
        non-control probes to plot intensity of detected genes, signal
        average for green and red. Outliers can be identified.
