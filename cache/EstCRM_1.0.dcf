Description: This package includes the tools to estimate item and
        person parameters for the Samejima's Continuous Response Model
        (CRM) via Marginal Maximum Likelihood and EM algorithm, to
        compute item fit residual statistics, to draw empirical 3D item
        category response curves, to draw theoretical 3D item category
        response curves, and to generate data under the CRM for
        simulation studies.
