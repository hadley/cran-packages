Description: This package facilitates analysis of paleontological
        sequences of trait values from an evolving lineage.  Functions
        are provided to fit, using maximum likelihood, evolutionary
        models including unbiased random walks, directional evolution,
        stasis, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models.  Newly added since
        version (0.3-1) are functions to analyze punctuations and
        models in which evolutionary dynamics change over the course of
        a time-series of trait values.
