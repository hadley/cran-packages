Description: This package lets you estimate the posterior distribution
        of various parameters regarding RNA Sequencing data. The most
        interesting parameter is the probability of differential
        expression (DE) between two groups A and B. But also estimates
        for the log mean and the log dispersion parameter of the
        underlying poisson - log-normal model can be returned.
