Description: The ChainLadder package provides various statistical
        methods which are typically used for the estimation of
        outstanding claims reserves in general insurance. The package
        has implementations of the Mack, Munich, Bootstrap, and
        multi-variate chain-ladder methods, as well as the loss
        development factor curve fitting methods of Dave Clark and
        generalised linear model based reserving models.
