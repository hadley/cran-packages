Description: RAMpath is a rewrite of RAMpath software developed by John
        McArdle and Steven Boker. However, it does more than the
        original software by providing flexible fit of growth curve
        models, univariate and bivariate latent change score models. It
        can also generate the vector field plot for the bivariate
        latent change score models.
