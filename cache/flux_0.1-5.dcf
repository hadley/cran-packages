Description: Functions for the calculation of greenhouse gas flux rates
        from closed chamber concentration measurements. The package
        follows a modular concept: Fluxes can be calculated in just two
        simple steps or in several steps if more control in details is
        wanted. Additionaly plot and preparation functions are
        provided.
