Description: The RQuantLib package makes selected parts of QuantLib 
 visible to the R user. Currently some basic option pricing 
 functions are included, as well as fixed-income functions that 
 can be used for interest rate curve construction and Bermuda 
 swaption pricing. Further software contributions are welcome.

 The QuantLib project aims to provide a comprehensive software 
 framework for quantitative finance. The goal is to provide a 
 standard open source library for quantitative analysis,
 modeling, trading, and risk management of financial
 assets.
 .
 The Windows binary version is self-contained and does not require 
 a QuantLib (or Boost) installation. 
 .
 RQuantLib use the Rcpp R/C++ interface class library. 	See the Rcpp 
 package on CRAN (or R-Forge) for more information on Rcpp.

 later), QuantLib itself is released under a somewhat less 
 restrictive Open Source license (see QuantLib-License.txt).
