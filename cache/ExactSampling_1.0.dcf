        for the k Nearest Neighbor algorithm.

Description: ExactSampling contains functions that estimate the risk
        associated to a kNN prediction function (either in regression
        or binary classification) based on resampling method
        (leave-p-out cross-validation or bootstrap). It also contain a
        function knn.search to obtain the list of k nearest neighbors
        for each point in the sample, and a function to compute the
        empirical risk of a kNN prediction function.
