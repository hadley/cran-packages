Description: An implementation of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attributes. See the ggplot2 website for more information, documentation and examples.
Depends: grid, reshape (>= 0.8.0), proto, RColorBrewer,
  splines, MASS, R (>= 2.7), plyr (>= 0.1.2)
