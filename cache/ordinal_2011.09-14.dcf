Description: This package implements cumulative link (mixed) models
        also known as ordered regression models, proportional odds
        models, proportional hazards models for grouped survival times
        and ordered logit/probit/... models. Estimation is via maximum
        likelihood and mixed models are fitted with the Laplace
        approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Multiple
        random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed
        or partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and
        equidistance can be imposed on the thresholds (cut-points).
        Standard model methods are available (summary, anova,
        drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in addition to
        profile methods and slice methods for visualizing the
        likelihood function and checking convergence.
