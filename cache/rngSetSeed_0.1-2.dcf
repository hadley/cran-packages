Description: The package provides a function setVectorSeed(vseed). Its
        argument is a vector of arbitrary nonzero length, including
        length 1, whose components have integer values in [0, 2^32-1]
        and which is used to initialize the R base Mersenne-Twister
        generator.  In order to guarantee that different input vectors
        yield unrelated streams of random numbers, a hash function
        based on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used for the
        transformation of vseed into the initial state of
        Mersenne-Twister.  Due to the use of AES, the function provides
        a better alternative to R base function set.seed() even if
        vseed is a single integer.  Initializing random number stream
        with a vector including an index of an R process allows to use
        reproducible and unrelated streams of random numbers in several
        independent R processes.  The package contains tests scripts,
        which verify its installation by comparing the output with a
        stored precomputed one and by comparing the encryption provided
        by C-level AES with an implementation of AES at the R-level,
        which is included for test purposes. See CRAN package "randaes"
        for a random number generator based purely on AES.
