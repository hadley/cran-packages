Description: This package provides robust estimation for generalized
        additive models. It implements a fast and stable algorithm in
        Wong, Yao and Lee (2013). The implementation also contains
        three automatic selection methods for smoothing parameter. They
        are designed to be robust to outliers. For more details, see
        Wong, Yao and Lee (2013).
