Title: Compute Effect Sizes

Description: This package contains several functions for calculating
        and converting various statistics, such as a t-test or p-value
        and sample size, to effect size estimates of d (mean
        difference), g (unbiased estimate of d), r (correlation
        coefficient), z (Fisher's z), and log odds ratio. The variance
        of these estimates are also computed. These
        calculation/conversion functions are a particularly useful
        resource during the preliminary stages of a meta-analytic
        project when deriving effect sizes from reported data. This
        package uses recommended formulas as described in The Handbook
        of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, &
        Valentine, 2009).
