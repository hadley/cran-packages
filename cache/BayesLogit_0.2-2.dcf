Description: The BayesLogit package does posterior simulation for
        binomial and multinomial logistic regression using the
        Polya-Gamma latent variable technique. This method is fully
        automatic, exact, and fast.  A routine to efficiently sample
        from the Polya-Gamma class of distributions is included.
