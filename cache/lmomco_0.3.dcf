Package: lmomco
Title: L-moments, L-comoments, and Distributions
Version: 0.3
Date: 2006-01-31
Author: William H. Asquith
Description: The package implements the statistical theory of L-moments including
 L-moment estimation, probability-weighted moment estimation, parameter estimation
 for numerous familiar and not-so-familiar distributions, and L-moment estimation
 for the same distributions from the parameters. L-moments are derived from the
 expectations of order statistics and are linear with respect to the probability-
 weighted moments. L-moments are directly analogous to the well-known product
 moments; however, L-moments have many advantages including unbiasedness,
 robustness, and consistency with respect to the product moments. This package
 is oriented around the FORTRAN algorithms of J.R.M. Hosking, and the
 nomenclature for many of the functions parallels that of the Hosking library.
 Further features are added to aid in extension of the breadth of L-moment
 application. Additionally, recent developments by Robert Serfling and Peng Xiao
 have extended L-moments into multivariate space; the so-called sample L-comoments
 are implemented here.
