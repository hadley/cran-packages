Description: Phylogenetic clustering (phyloclustering) is an
        evolutionary Continuous Time Markov Chain model-based approach
        to identify population structure from molecular data without
        assuming linkage equilibrium. It provides a convenient
        implementation of phyloclustering for DNA and SNP data, capable
        of clustering individuals into subpopulations and identifying
        molecular sequences representative of those subpopulations. It
        is designed in C for performance, interfaced with R for
        visualization, and incorporates other popular open source
        software, ms, seq-gen and Hap-Clustering for simulating data
        and additional analyses. See the phyclust website for more
        information, documentations and examples.
