Description: MixSim allows simulating mixtures of Gaussian
        distributions with different levels of overlap between mixture
        components.  Pairwise overlap, defined as a sum of two
        misclassification probabilities, measures the degree of
        interaction between components and can be readily employed to
        control the complexity of datasets simulated from mixtures.
        These datasets can then be used for systematic performance
        investigation of clustering and finite mixture modeling
        algorithms. Among other capabilities of MixSim, there are
        computing the exact overlap for Gaussian mixtures, simulating
        Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, simulating outliers and noise
        variables, calculating various measures of agreement between
        two partitionings, and constructing parallel distribution plots
        for the graphical display of finite mixture models.
