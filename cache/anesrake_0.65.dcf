Description: This package provides a comprehensive system for selecting
        variables and weighting data to match the specifications of the
        American National Election Studies.  The package includes
        methods for identifying discrepant variables, raking data, and
        assessing the effects of the raking algorithm.  It also allows
        automated re-raking if target variables fall outside identified
        bounds and allows greater user specification than other
        available raking algorithms. A variety of simple weighted
        statistics that were previously in this package (version .55
        and earlier) have been moved to the package 'weights.'
