Description: A collection of functions that primarily produce graphics to aid in a
  Propensity Score Analysis (PSA).  Functions include: cat.psa and box.psa to test
  balance within strata of categorical and quantitative covariates,
  circ.psa for a representation of the estimated effect size by stratum,
  loess.psa that provides a graphic and loess based effect size estimate,
  and various balance functions that provide measures of the balance achieved
  via a PSA in a categorical covariate.
