Description: This package uses item response theory methods to compute linking constants and conduct
	chain linking of tests for multiple groups under a nonequivalent groups common item design. 
	It allows for mean/mean, mean/sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord calibrations of dichotomous 
	(1PL, 2PL, and 3PL) and/or polytomous (graded response, partial credit/generalized partial
	credit, nominal, and multiple-choice model) common items.
