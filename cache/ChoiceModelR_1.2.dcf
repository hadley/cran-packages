Description: Implements an MCMC algorithm to estimate a hierarchical
        multinomial logit model with a normal heterogeneity
        distribution. The algorithm uses a hybrid Gibbs Sampler with a
        random walk metropolis step for the MNL coefficients for each
        unit. Dependent variable may be discrete or continuous.
        Independent variables may be discrete or continuous with
        optional order constraints. Means of the distribution of
        heterogeneity can optionally be modeled as a linear function of
        unit characteristics variables.
