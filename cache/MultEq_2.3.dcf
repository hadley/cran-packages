Description: Equivalence tests and related confidence intervals for the
        comparison of two treatments, simultaneously for one or many
        normally distributed, primary response variables (endpoints).
        The step-up procedure of Quan et al. (2001) is both applied for
        differences and extended to ratios of means. A related
        single-step procedure is also available.
