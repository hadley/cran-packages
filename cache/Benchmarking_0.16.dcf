Description: The package contains methods to support frontier analysis.
        It covers Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA is supported
        under different technology assumptions (fdh, vrs, drs, crs,
        irs, add), and using different efficiency measures (input
        based, output based, hyperbolic graph, additive, super,
        directional). Peers and slacks are available, partial price
        information can be included, and optimal cost, revenue and
        profit can be calculated. Evaluation of mergers are also
        supported. Methods for graphing the technology sets are also
        included. The package also support comparative methods based on
        Stochastic Frontier Analyses (SFA). In general, the methods can
        be used to solve not only standard models, but also many other
        model variants. The package complements the textbook, Bogetoft
        and Otto, Benchmarking with DEA, SFA, and R, Springer-Verlag,
        2011, but can of course also be used as a stand-alone package.
