Description: New disciminant analysis and data clustering methods for
        high dimensional data, based on the asumption that
        high-dimensional data live in different subspaces with low
        dimensionality proposing a new parametrization of the Gaussian
        mixture model which combines the ideas of dimension reduction
        and constraints on the model.
