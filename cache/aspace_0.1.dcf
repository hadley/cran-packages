Description: A collection of functions for computing centrographic satistics (e.g., standard distance, standard deviation ellipse), and minimum convex polygons (MCP)for observations taken at point locations.  A tool is also provided for converting geometric objects associated with the centrographic statistics, and MCPs into ESRI Shapefiles.
