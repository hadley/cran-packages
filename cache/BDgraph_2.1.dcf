Description: The R package BDgraph is a statistical tool for Bayesian
        model selection in undirected Gaussian graphical models. Our
        Bayesian methodology is based on birth-death MCMC algorithm.
        The main function is 'bdmcmc' which is a birth-death MCMC
        algorithm for Bayesian model selection in undirected Gaussian
        graphical models.
