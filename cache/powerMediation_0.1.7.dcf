Description: The package contains functions (1) for calculating power,
        sample size, and minimal detectable mediation effect for
        testing mediation effect in linear, logistic, Poisson, or cox 
        regression; (2) for calculating power, sample size, and minimal detectable slope
        for testing the slope in a simple linear regression (only one
        predictor); (3) for calculating power, and sample size for testing odds ratio
        in a simple logistic regression with continuous predictor or binary predictor;
        (4) for calculating power, and sample size for testing mean change for longitudinal study with 2 time points.
