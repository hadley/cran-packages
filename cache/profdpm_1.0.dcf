Title: Profile Dirichlet Process Mixtures
Version: 1.0

Author: Matt Shotwell

Description: This package performs profile inference for models
        utilizing the Dirichlet process (DP) and Dirichlet motivated
        process (DMP) mixtures. This method is not based on Markov
        chain Monte Carlo methods, as are most other mechanisms of
        inference in DP and DMP mixtures. This method searches for the
        maximum posterior (MAP) estimate for the cluster indicators in
        the DP or DMP mixture model.
