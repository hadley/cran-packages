Description: This package is devoted to the IVIVC linear level A with
        numerical deconvolution method. The latter is working for
        inequal and incompatible timepoints between impulse and
        response curves. A numerical convolution method is also
        available. Application domains include pharamaceutical industry
        QA/QC and R&D together with academic research.
