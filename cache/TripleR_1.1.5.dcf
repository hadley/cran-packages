Description: Social Relation Model (SRM) analyses for single or
        multiple round-robin groups are performed. These analyses are
        either based on one manifest variable, one latent construct
        measured by two manifest variables, two manifest variables and
        their bivariate relations, or two latent constructs each
        measured by two manifest variables. Within-group t-tests for
        variance components and covariances are provided for single
        groups, between-groups t-tests for multiple groups. Handling
        for missing values is provided.
