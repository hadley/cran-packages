Maintainer: Sanford Weisberg <sandy@stat.umn.edu>
Description:  This library is a companion to the textbook S. Weisberg (2005), 
 "Applied Linear Regression," 3rd edition, Wiley. It includes all the
 data sets discussed in the book (except one), and several few functions that 
 are tailored to the methods discussed in the book.  Ver. 1.0.3 corrects bugs in (1) weights for POD models; (2) use of 'subset' arguments with boot.case.  Ver. 1.0.4 corrects a few bugs with overparameterized models. Ver. 1.0.5 changes one default argument. Ver 1.0.6 replaces the pure.error.anova function so it prints nicer and works with interactions. Ver 1.0.7 fixes a bug in residual.plots and
 adds an additional argument and adds a new function alrweb to access the 
 website for the book in a browser. Ver 1.0.8 fixed a bug in delta.method for
 generalized linear models. Ver 1.0.9 fixes a bug with Yeo Johnson 
 transformations.
