Title: Multivariate time series data imputation
Description: This is a EM algorithm based method for imputation of
        missing values in multivariate normal time series. The
        imputation algorithm accounts for both spatial and temporal
        correlation structures. Temporal patterns can be modelled using
        an ARIMA(p,d,q), optionally with seasonal components, a
        non-parametric cubic spline or generalised additive models with
        exogenous covariates. This algorithm is specially tailored for
        climate data with missing measurements from several monitors
        along a given region.
