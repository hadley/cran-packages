Description: This package allows to estimate both tail area-based false
        discovery rates (Fdr) as well as local false discovery rates
        (fdr) for a variety of null models (p-values, z-scores,
        correlation coefficients, t-scores).  The proportion of null
        values and the parameters of the null distribution are
        adaptively estimated from the data.  In addition, the package
        contains functions for non-parametric density estimation
        (Grenander estimator), for monotone regression (isotonic
        regression and antitonic regression with weights), for
        computing the greatest convex minorant (GCM) and the least
        concave majorant (LCM), for the half-normal and correlation
        distributions, and for computing empirical higher criticism
        (HC) scores and the corresponding decision threshold.
