Description: Data handling and estimation functions for animal movement
        estimation by light level and satellite data. Image summaries
        from MCMC simulations of point data, binned by time interval.
        Various convenience functions for creating generic summary
        images for periods defined by the location estimation and
        combining those in arbitrarily specified ways.
