Depends:  R(>= 2.0.1),rpart
Description: Performs discrete, real, and gentle boost under both exponential and 
             logistic loss on a given data set.  The package ada provides a straightforward, 
             well-documented, and broad boosting routine for classification, ideally suited 
             for small to moderate-sized data sets.  Please refer to the Url below for more
