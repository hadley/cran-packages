Description: pkg{GeneReg} is an R package for inferring time delay gene
        regulatory network using time course gene expression profiles.
        The main idea of time delay linear model is to fit a linear
        regression model using a set of putative regulators to estimate
        the transcription pattern of a specific target gene.
