Package: GeneNT
Title: Relevance or Dependency network and signaling pathway discovery
Version: 1.3
Author: Dongxiao Zhu (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~zhud/genent.htm)
Description: The package implements a two-stage algorithm to screen co-expressed
	gene pairs with controlled False Discovery Rate (FDR) and Minimum Acceptable Strength 
	(MAS). The packages also constructs relevance networks and clusters co-expressed 
	genes (both similarly co-expressed and transitively co-expressed). In addtion, it 
	includes new correlation estimators and non-parametric statistical inference procedure 
        for replicated gene microarray data.
