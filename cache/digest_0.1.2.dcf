Title: Create cryptographic hash digests of R objects
Description: The digest package provides two functions for the creation of
	`hash' digests of arbitrary R objects using the md5 and sha-1 
        algorithms permitting easy comparison of R language objects. 
	The md5 algorithm by Ron Rivest is specified in RFC 1321. The SHA-1 
        algorithm is specified in FIPS-180-1. This packages uses two small 
	standalone C implementations (that were provided by by Christophe
        Devine) of the md5 and sha-1 algorithms.  
	Please note that this package is not meant to be used for 
	cryptographic purposes for which more comprehensive (and widely 
        tested) libraries such as OpenSSL should be used.
Depends: R (>= 1.8.1)
