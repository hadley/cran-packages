Description: CpGassoc is designed to test for association between
        methylation at CpG sites across the genome and a phenotype of
        interest, adjusting for any relevant covariates. The package
        can perform standard analyses of large datasets very quickly
        with no need to impute the data. It can also handle mixed
        effects models with chip or batch entering the model as a
        random intercept.  CpGassoc also includes tools to apply
        quality control filters, perform permutation tests, and create
        QQ plots, manhattan plots, and scatterplots for individual CpG
        sites.
