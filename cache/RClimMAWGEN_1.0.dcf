Title: RClimMAWGEN (R Climate Index Multi-site Auto-regressive Weather
        GENeretor): a package to generate time series of climate
        indices from RMAWGEN generations.
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano, Annalisa Di Piazza
Description: This package contains wrapper functions and methods which
        allow to use "climdex.pcic" and "RMAWGEN" packages.  With this
        simple approach it is possible to calculate climate change
        indices, suggested by the WMO-CCL, CLIVAR,
        ETCCDMI(http://www.climdex.org),on stochastic generations of
        temperature and precipitation time series, obtained by the
        application of RMAWGEN.  Each index can be applied to both
        observed data and to synthetic time series produced by the
        Weather Generator, over a reference period (e.g. 1981-2010, as
        in the example). It contains also functions and methods to
        evaluate the generated time series of climate change indices
        consistency by statistical
        tests.Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind are
        warmly welcomed.
