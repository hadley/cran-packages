Description: waffect (pronounced 'double-u affect' for 'weighted
        affectation') is a package to simulate phenotypic (case or
        control) datasets under a disease model H1 such that the total
        number of cases is constant across all the simulations (the
        constrain in the title). The package also makes it possible to
        generate phenotypes in the case of more than two classes, so
        that the number of phenotypes belonging to each class is
        constant across all the simulations. waffect is used to assess
        empirically the statistical power of Genome Wide Association
        studies.
