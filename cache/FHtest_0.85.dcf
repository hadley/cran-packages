Description: FHtest offers several tests for the comparison of two or
        more survival curves: a) The Fleming-Harrington test for
        right-censored data based on permutations and on count-ing
        processes.  b) Extension of the Fleming-Harrington test for
        interval-censored data based on a permuta-tion distribution and
        on a score vector distribution.
