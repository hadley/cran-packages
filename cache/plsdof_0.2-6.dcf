Description: The plsdof package provides Degrees of Freedom estimates
        for Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression. Model selection for
        PLS is based on various information criteria (aic, bic, gmdl)
        or on cross-validation. Estimates for the mean and covariance
        of the PLS regression coefficients are available. They allow
        the construction of approximate confidence intervals and the
        application of test procedures. Further, cross-validation
        procedures for Ridge Regression and Principal Components
        Regression are available.
