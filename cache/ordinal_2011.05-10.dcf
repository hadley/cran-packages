Description: This package implements likelihood based models for
        ordinal (ordered categorical) data based on cumulative
        probabilities in the framework of cumulative link (mixed)
        models. This includes the important proportional odds model but
        also allows for general regression structures for location as
        well as scale of the latent distribution, i.e. additive as well
        as multiplicative structures, structured thresholds
        (cut-points), nominal effects, flexible link functions and
        random effects. Further, a range of estimation procedures and a
        range of auxiliary functions are implemented.
