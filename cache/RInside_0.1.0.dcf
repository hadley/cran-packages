Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications The RInside
        packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your C++
        application by providing a few wrapper classes.
 .
 As R itself is embedded, a shared library build of R is required. This
        works on Linux and OS X, but not necessarily on Windows due to
        the way R is built on Windows.
