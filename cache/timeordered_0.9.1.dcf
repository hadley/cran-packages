Description: Methods for incorporating time into network analysis.
        Construction of time-ordered networks (temporal graphs).
        Shortest-time and shortest-path-length analyses. Resource
        spread calculations. Data resampling and rarefaction for null
        model construction. Reduction to time-aggregated networks with
        variable window sizes; application of common descriptive
        statistics to these networks. Vector clock latencies. Plotting
        functionalities & full compatibility with all network methods
        in the igraph0 library.
