Title: mchof: multicore higher-order-functions
Description: mchof (read: mc'hoff) provides convenient, consistent
        parallel implementations of several commonly used higher-order
        functions found in base R. Excellent parallel implementations
        of map-like functions exist in packages such as plyr and
        parallel, giving users better efficiency with little work on
        their part. This package aims to extend this speedup to people
        who use functions like Filter or Reduce in their code.
