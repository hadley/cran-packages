Description: R package for simulation of IBD sharing among family
        members. Using sex specific recombination rates from the Decode
        map (2010) of the human genome, phased chromosomes are
        simulated for all pedigree members, either by unconditional
        'gene dropping' or conditional on a specified IBD pattern.
        Regions compatible with the query IBD pattern (possibly
        different from the conditional pattern) are subsequently
        detected and summarized.
