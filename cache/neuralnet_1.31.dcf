Description: Training of neural networks using backpropagation,
        resilient backpropagation with (Riedmiller, 1994) or without
        weight backtracking (Riedmiller and Braun, 1993) or the
        modified globally convergent version by Anastasiadis et al.
        (2005). The package allows flexible settings through
        custom-choice of error and activation function. Furthermore,
        the calculation of generalized weights (Intrator O & Intrator
        N, 1993) is implemented.
