Description: scaRabee is a port of the Scarabee toolkit originally
        written as a Matlab-based application. It provides a framework
        for simulation and optimization of
        pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models in a naive
        average/pooling settings. It is built on top of the neldermead
        package, which provides the direct search algorithm proposed by
        Nelder and Mead for model optimization.
