Description: mcgibbsit provides an implementation of Warnes & Raftery's
        MCGibbsit run-length diagnostic for a set of (not-necessarily
        independent) MCMC sampers.  It combines the estimate
        error-bounding approach of Raftery and Lewis with evaulate
        between verses within chain approach of Gelman and Rubin.
