Description: This package provides a wrapper to the FITPACK routines
        written by Paul Dierckx. The original Fortran is available from
        http://www.netlib.org/dierckx 2012.02.15: This package is
        broken.  Currently, it seems NOT to have any users and is not
        worth fixing.  These FITPACK routines are over 20 years old and
        may be obsolete.  If you want to fix it, I will happily make
        you the maintainer.  Spencer Graves
