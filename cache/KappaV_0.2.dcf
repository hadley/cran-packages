        patchy mosaics.

Description: this package allows to quantify the congruence between two patchy mosaics or landscapes. This "vectorial Kappa" approach extends the principle of Cohen's Kappa index by calculating areas of intersected patches between two mosaics rather than agreement between pixels. It provides an exact alternative for patchy mosaics when a Kappa index is needed.
