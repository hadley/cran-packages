Title: Choi and Hall Clustering in 3d
Version: 0.2
Author: Douglas G. Woolford <dgwoolfo@uwo.ca>
Description: Functions that cluster 3 dimensional data into their local
        modes.  Based on a convergent form of Choi and Hall's (1999)
        data sharpening method.  Note: sharp3dB is much faster than
        sharp3d if data is ordered in at least one dimension.
