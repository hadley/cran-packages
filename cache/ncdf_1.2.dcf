Title: Interface to Unidata netCDF data files
Maintainer:  David Pierce <dpierce@ucsd.edu>
Version: 1.2
Author: David Pierce
Description: This package provides a high-level R interface to Unidata's
 netCDF data files, which are portable across platforms and include
 metadata information in addition to the data sets.  
 Using this package netCDF files can be opened and data sets read in easily.
 It is also easy to create new netCDF dimensions, variables, and files,
 or manipulate existing netCDF files.
 This interface provides considerably more functionality than the "netCDF"
 package.  It is not compatible with the "netCDF" package.
 Release 1.2 adds better support for character variables, and miscellaneous
 bug fixes.
