Description: This package serves two purposes: (i) Provide a
        comfortable R interface to query the Google server for static
        maps, and (ii) Use the map as a background image to overlay
        plots within R. This requires proper coordinate scaling. NOTE:
        To do anything but downloading static map tiles, RgoogleMaps
        needs EITHER png OR ReadImages OR rimage installed ! png
        (default) is your package if you prefer png file format and
        ReadImages or rimage if you prefer jpg format. In the latter
        cases, you will also need the libjpeg library installed.
