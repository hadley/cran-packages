Author: Jan Wijffels
Description: Provides functions to facilitate the use of the ff package
        in interaction with bigdata in SQL databases (e.g. in
        Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL) by allowing easy importing directly
        into ffdf objects using DBI and RODBC.  Also contains some
        basic utility functions to do fast left outer join merging
        based on match and basic recoding.
