Title: Track Objects
Author: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Maintainer: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Description: Automatically stores objects in files on disk so that
        files are rewritten when objects are changed, and so that
        objects are accessible but do not occupy memory until they are
        accessed. Keeps track of times when objects are created and
        modified, and caches some basic characteristics of objects to
        allow for fast summaries of objects.  Also provides a command
        history mechanism that saves the last command to a history file
        after each command completes.
