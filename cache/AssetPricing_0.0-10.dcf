Description: Calculates the optimal price of assets (such as airline
        flight seats, hotel room bookings) whose value becomes zero
        after a fixed ``expiry date''.  Assumes potential customers
        arrive (possibly in groups) according to a known inhomogeneous
        Poisson process.  Also assumes a known time-varying elasticity
        of demand (price sensitivity) function.  Uses elementary
        techniques based on ordinary differential equations, solved
        numerically via the method of Runge-Kutta.
