Description: Library of econometric functions for performance and risk
        analysis. This library aims to aid practitioners and
        researchers in utilizing the latest research in analysis of
        non-normal return streams.  In general, this library is most
        tested on return (rather than price) data on a monthly scale,
        but most functions will work with daily or irregular return
        data as well.
Depends: R (>= 2.9.0), zoo, xts (>= 0.6-8)
Suggests: Hmisc, MASS, tseries, quadprog, sn, robustbase, quantreg
