Description: Compute a matrix comparison of lists (from 2 to infinite)
        and plot the results in a Venn diagram if (N<=4). It is
        possible to produce a complete annotated file, merging the
        annotations of the compared lists. It is also possible to
        compute an overlaps table to compute the overlaps proportions
        of all the couples of lists.
