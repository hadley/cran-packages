Title: Manage and manipulate large collections of R objects stored as
        tape-like files
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Miron B. Kursa
Description: Storing huge data in RData format causes problems because
        of the nessesity to load the whole file to the memory in order
        to access and manipulate objects inside such file; rtape is a
        simple solution to this problem. The package contains serveral
        wrappers of R built-in serialize/unserialize mechanism allowing
        user to quickly append objects to a tape-like file and later
        iterate over them requiring only one copy of each stored object
        to reside in memory a time.
