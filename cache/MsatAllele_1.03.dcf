Description: The package contains functions to: 1) load ah files from Strand software and build a R data 
	base; 2) plot different graphical displays of the fragment sizes obtained for each locus and their bins; 3) 
	interact with graphs to sort the data base for a given locus and range, allowing to easily  trace back a 
	particular group of samples to its original Strand file; bin fragment size data into population genetics files.
