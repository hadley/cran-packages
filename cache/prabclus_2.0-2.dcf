Description: Distance-based parametric bootstrap tests for clustering, 
  mainly intended for presence-absence data (clustering of species
  distribution maps). Jaccard, Kulczynski and geco distance measures, 
  clustering of presence-absence and abundance data, and nearest neighbor 
  based noise detection (R port of Byers
  and Raftery's (1998) "NNclean"). Main functions are prabtest (for
  testing), prabclust (for clustering), prabinit (for preparing the data)
  and NNclean (for noise detection). The help-pages for prabtest and
  prabclust contain simple standard executions.
