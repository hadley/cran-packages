Description: rpanel provides a set of functions to build simple GUI
        controls for R functions.  These are built on the tcltk
        package.  Uses could include changing a parameter on a graph by
        animating it with a slider or a "doublebutton", up to more
        sophisticated control panels.  Some functions for specific
        graphical tasks, referred to as 'cartoons', are provided.
