Title: Extensible Markov Model (EMM) for Data Stream Clustering in R
Author: Michael Hahsler and Margaret H. Dunham
Maintainer: Michael Hahsler <mhahsler@lyle.smu.edu>
Description: This package implements TRACDS (Temporal Relationships 
    between Clusters for Data Streams) which is a generalization of 
    Extensible Markov Model (EMM). TRACDS adds a temporal or order model
    to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically adapting
    Markov Chain. This package implements EMM (TRACDS on top of tNN 
    data stream clustering). Development of this 
    package was supported in part by NSF IIS-0948893 and R21HG005912 from 
    the National Human Genome Research Institute.
