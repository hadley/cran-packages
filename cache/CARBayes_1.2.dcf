Description: This package implements Bayesian hierarchical spatial
        areal unit models. In such models the spatial correlation is
        modelled by a set of random effects, which are assigned a
        conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. Examples
        of the models included are the BYM model as well as recently
        developed localised spatial smoothing models. In addition,
        Moran's I and Geary's C permutation tests for spatial
        correlation can be implemented.The creation of this package was
        supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)
        grant RES-000-22-4256.
