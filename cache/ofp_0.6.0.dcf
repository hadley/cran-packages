Description: A package with three interrelated parts: Firstly, a
        framework for enhanced S3 programming, emphasizing simplicity
        and readability; Secondly, a framework for object-functional
        programming (a programming paradigm that mixes features of
        object oriented programming and functional programming) and;
        Thirdly, a framework for smoothing and interpolation. This
        package is very experimental.
