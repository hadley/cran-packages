Description: Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets)
        which allows binary requests to be sent to R. Every connection
        has a separate workspace and working directory. Client-side
        implementations are available for popular languages such as
        C/C++ and Java, allowing any application to use facilities of R
        without the need of linking to R code. Rserve supports remote
        connection, user authentication and file transfer. A simple R
        client is included in this package as well.
