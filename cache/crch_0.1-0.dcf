Description: Different approaches to censored regression with conditional
  heteroscedasticity are provided. First, continuous distributions can be used
  for the (right and/or left censored) response with separate linear predictors
  for the mean and variance. Second, cumulative link models for ordinal data
  (obtained by interval-censoring continuous data) can be employed for
  heteroscedastic extended logistic regression (HXLR). In the latter type of
  models, the intercepts depend on the thresholds that define the intervals.
