Description: The package was developd to fit fit many growth curves
        obtained under different conditions in order to derive a
        conclusive dose-repsonse curve, for instance for a compound
        that potentially affects growth. grofit fits data to different
        parametric models (function gcFitModel) and in addition
        provides a model free spline fit (function gcFitSpline) to
        circumvent systematic errors that might occur within
        application of parametric methods.
