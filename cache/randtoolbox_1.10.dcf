        Wuertz (except underlying C codes of (i) the SFMT algorithm
        from M. Matsumoto and M. Saito, (ii) the Knuth-TAOCP RNG from
        D. Knuth). See LICENCE file for details.
Maintainer: Christophe Dutang <christophe.dutang@ensimag.fr>
Description: The package provides (1) pseudo random generators -
        general linear congruential generators (Park Miller) and
        multiple recursive generators (Knuth TAOCP), generalized
        feedback shift register (SF-Mersenne Twister algorithm and WELL
        generators); (2) quasi random generators - the Torus algorithm,
        the Sobol sequence, the Halton sequence (thus include Van der
        Corput sequence) and (3) some additional tests such as the gap
        test, the serial test, the poker test... The package depends on
        rngWELL package but it can be provided without this dependency
        on demand to the maintainer. For true random number generation,
        use the 'random' package, for Latin Hypercube Sampling (a
        hybrid QMC method), use the 'lhs' package, a number of RNGs and
        tests for RNGs are provided by 'RDieHarder', all available on
        CRAN. There is also a small stand-alone package 'rngwell19937'
        for the WELL19937a RNG.
