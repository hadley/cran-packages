Title: Methods for dimension reduction for regression

Description: Functions, methods, and datasets for fitting dimension
        reduction regression, using slicing (methods SAVE and SIR),
        Principal Hessian Directions (phd, using residuals and the
        response), and an iterative IRE.  Partial methods, that
        condition on categorical predictors are also available.  A
        variety of tests, and stepwise deletion of predictors, is also
        included.  Also included is code for computing permutation
        tests of dimension.  Adding additional methods of estimating
        dimension is straightforward.  For documentation, see the
        vignette in the package.  With version 3.0.4, the arguments for
        dr.step have been modified.
