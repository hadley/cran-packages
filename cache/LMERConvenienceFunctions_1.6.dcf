Description: Functions to back-fit fixed effects (on F or t values and,
        potentially, log-likelihood ratio testing) and to forward-fit
        random effects (using log-likelihood ratio testing). Note that
        the back- and forward-fitting of generalized linear
        mixed-effects regression (\code{glmer}s) models is not yet
        supported. The package also includes a function to compute
        ANOVAs with upper- and lower-bound p-values (anti-conservative
        and conservative, respectively), a function to graph model
        criticism plots, functions to trim data on model residuals or
        on a response variable (per subject), a function to perform
        posthoc analyses, and a function to plot (dynamic) 3d plots pf
        models fitted by LMER.
