Description: Beta regression for modeling beta-distributed dependent
        variables, e.g., rates and proportions.  In addition to maximum
        likelihood regression (for both mean and precision of a
        beta-distributed response), bias-corrected and bias-reduced
        estimation as well as finite mixture models and recursive
        partitioning for beta regressions are provided.
