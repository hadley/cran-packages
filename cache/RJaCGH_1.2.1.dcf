Description: Bayesian analysis of CGH microarrays fitting Hidden Markov Chain models. 
             The selection of the number of states is made via their posterior probability
             computed by Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods. Also
	     returns probabilistic minimal common regions for gains/losses.
