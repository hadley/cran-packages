Description: Imports bead-summary data from Illumina scanner.
        Pre-processes using a suite of optional normalizations and
        transformations. Clusters and automatically calls genotypes,
        critically able to handle markers in duplicated regions of the
        genome (multisite variants; MSVs). Interactive clustering if
        needed. MSVs with variation in both paralogs may be resolved
        and mapped to their respective chromosomes. Quality control
        including pedigree checking and visual assessment of clusters.
        Too large data-sets are handled by working on smaller subsets
        of the data in sequence.
