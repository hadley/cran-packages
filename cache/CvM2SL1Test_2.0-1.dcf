Description: The package contains two functions for L1-version of 
  Cramer-von Mises Tests: one computes Cramer-von Mises
  two sample test scores, the other cmoputes the exact p-value(s) for given 
  Cramer-von Mises two-sample test score(s) under the assumption that
  the populations under comparison have the same probability distribution.
  The L1-version Cramer-von Mises test, like its L2 counterpart,
  is distribution-free, but of less computational intensity. In certain cases,
  this version of Cramer-von Mises test is almost as powerful as its L2 counterpart.
  Simulation study also shows that it is more powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
  test in certain cases.
