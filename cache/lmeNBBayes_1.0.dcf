Description: This package contains a gibbs sampler to sample from the
        posterior distribution of the negative binomial mixed-effect
        regression model. For the distribution of subject-specific
        random intercept, user can choose a beta distribution or an
        infinite mixture of beta distributions. For the safety
        monitoring, subject-specific conditional probability indices
        can be computed. For details, see Kondo,Y. and Zhao, Y. A

        Detecting Abrupt Increase in MRI Lesion Counts in Multiple
        Sclerosis Patients.
