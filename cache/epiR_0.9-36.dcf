        disease frequency, quantifying measures of association on the
        basis of single or multiple strata of count data presented in a
        contingency table, and computing confidence intervals around
        incidence risk and incidence rate estimates.  Miscellaneous
        functions for use in meta-analysis, diagnostic test
        interpretation, and sample size calculations.
