Description: A collection of functions that primarily produce graphics
        to aid in a Propensity Score Analysis (PSA).  Functions
        include: cat.psa and box.psa to test balance within strata of
        categorical and quantitative covariates, circ.psa for a
        representation of the estimated effect size by stratum,
        loess.psa that provides a graphic and loess based effect size
        estimate, and various balance functions that provide measures
        of the balance achieved via a PSA in a categorical covariate.
