Description: gitter is a image analysis package for R. Its primary goal
        is to allow users to robustly and quickly grid and quantify
        biological images of pinned colonies. It includes several image
        pre-processing techniques, such as autorotation of plates,
        noise removal, contrast adjustment and image resizing.
