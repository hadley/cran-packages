Description: This package allows simple computation of a full set of
        spatial statistic functions of distance, including classical
        ones (Ripley's K and others) and more recent onces used by
        spatial economists (Duranton and Overman's Kd, Marcon and
        Puech's M). It relies on spatstat for core calculation.
