Description: This package provides functions to calculate the
        efficiencies (expected tests per unit) of hierarchical and
        matrix group testing procedures.  Efficiencies can be
        calculated in the presense of correlated responses under
        multiple arrangements of clustesrs.  Efficiencies can also be
        evaluated in the presense of test error.
