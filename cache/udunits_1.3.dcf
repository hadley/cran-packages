Title: interface to Unidata's routines to convert units
Maintainer: David Pierce <dpierce@ucsd.edu>
Version: 1.3
Author: David Pierce
Description: This package provides an R interface to the Unidata
  udunits library routines, which can convert quantities between various units.
  Units are indicated by human-readable strings, such as "m/s", "J",
  "kg", or "in".  Routines for converting any quantity in known units
  to other compatible units are provided.  Of particular use are the
  time and calendar conversion routines.  Calendar dates are given
  with units such as "days since 1900-01-01", for example.  Values with
  this unit can be converted to normal, readable calendar dates.  This
  will let you find that "32018 days since 1900-01-01" is actually
  31 Aug 1987.  These routines follow the library's C interface, so consult that
  section of Unidata's udunits manual for reference.  Here are some
  example formatted units strings that can be used: "10 kilogram.meters/seconds2",
  "10 kg-m/sec2", "10 kg m/s^2", "(PI radian)2", "degF", "degC", "100rpm",
  "geopotential meters", "33 feet water".  Note that the udunits library
  must already be installed on your machine for this package to work.
  Change log: v1.3: added support for non-standard calendars in routine
  'utCalendar'.
