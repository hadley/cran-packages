Description: Several testing procedures including the global likelihood
        ratio test (Bartholomew, 1961), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus
        (1976), M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007)
        are used to test for the monotonic trend in gene expression
        with respect to doses. BH (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) and BY
        (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2004) FDR controlling procedures are
        applied to adjust the raw p-values obtained from the
        permutations.
