Description: This package contains functions to compute the
        nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the
        bivariate distribution of (X,Y), when realizations of (X,Y)
        cannot be observed directly. To be more precise, we consider
        the situation where we observe a set of rectangles (that we
        call 'observation rectangles') that are known to contain the
        unobservable realizations of (X,Y). We compute the MLE based on
        such a set of rectangles. The methods can also be used for
        univariate censored data (see data set 'cosmesis'), and for
        censored data with competing risks (see data set 'menopause').
        We also provide functions to visualize the observed data and
        the MLE. (This package contains the functionality of the
        R-package 'bicreduc', which will no longer be maintained.)
