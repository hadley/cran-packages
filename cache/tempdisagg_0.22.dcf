Title: Methods for Temporal Disaggregation and Interpolation of Time
        Series
Author: Christoph Sax, Peter Steiner
Maintainer: Christoph Sax <christoph.sax@gmail.com>
Description: Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate
    and interpolate a low frequency time series to a higher
    frequency series. This can be done without additional
    information or by exploiting the information contained in one
    or more indicators. All disaggregation methods ensure that
    either the sum, the average, the first or the last value of the
    resulting high frequency series is consistent with the low
    frequency series.
