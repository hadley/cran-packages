Description: 
	apTreeshape is mainly dedicated to simulation and analysis of phylogenetic tree topologies using statistical indices. It is a companion library of the 'ape' package. It provides additional functions for reading, plotting, manipulating phylogenetic trees. It also offers convenient web-access to public databases, and enables testing null models of macroevolution using corrected test statistics.  Trees of class "phylo" (from 'ape' package) can be converted easily.
