Description: Computes the euclidean distance between rows of a matrix X
        and rows of another matrix Y.  Previously, this could only be
        done by binding the two matrices together and calling 'dist',
        but this creates unnecessary computation by computing the
        distances between a row of X and another row of X, and likewise
        for Y.
