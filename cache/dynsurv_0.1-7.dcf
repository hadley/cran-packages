Description: Functions to fit time-varying coefficient models for
        interval censored and right censored survival data. Three major
        approaches are implemented: 1) Bayesian Cox model with
        time-independent, time-varying or dynamic coefficients for
        right censored and interval censored data; 2) Spline based
        time-varying coefficient Cox model for right censored data; 3)
        Transformation model with time-varying coefficients for right
        censored data using estimating equations.
