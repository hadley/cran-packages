Description: Haplin performs a genetic association analysis of
        case-parent triad (trio) data with multiple markers. It can
        also incorporate complete or incomplete control triads, for
        instance independent control children. Estimation is based on
        haplotypes, for instance SNP haplotypes, even though phase is
        not known from the genetic data. Haplin estimates relative risk
        (RR + conf.int.) and p-value associated with each haplotype. It
        uses maximum likelihood estimation to make optimal use of data
        from triads with missing genotypic data, for instance if some
        SNPs has not been typed for some individuals. Haplin also
        allows estimation of effects of maternal haplotypes and
        parent-of-origin effects, particularly appropriate in perinatal
        epidemiology. Haplin allows special models, like
        X-inactivation, to be fitted on the X-chromosome.
