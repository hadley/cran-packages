Description: Simulation functions to assess the optimal design and
        performance of random intercept and slope models (i.e. mixed
        models), which can be used to a priori determine adequate
        sampling designs for e.g. reaction norm studies. Functions
        allow users to vary the sampling design in terms of number of
        grouping units sampled (e.g. individuals, schools, populations,
        etc.) and replicates per grouping unit (unbalanced as well
        balanced datasets) and also allow users to vary the parameter
        conditions used to generate the data. Subsequently, the
        performance of mixed models (based on lme4 package) fitted on
        these datasets is assessed in terms of the accuracy and the
        precision of estimates of fixed and random parameter, as well
        as the statistical power.
