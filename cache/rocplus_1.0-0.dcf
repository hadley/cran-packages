Description: Creates single and multiple ROC plots, precision-recall,
        Bayes plots and others. The plots may be either rough or smooth
        with confidence limits. Threshold values, optimum points and
        other interesting points may be marked on the plots. The convex
        hull for multiple curves with blending fractions for
        interesting points may be obtained. The axes may have normal or
        lognormal scaling.
