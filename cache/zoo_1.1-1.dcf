Description: An S3 class with methods for totally ordered indexed
             observations. It is particularly aimed at irregular
	     time series of numeric vectors/matrices and factors.
	     zoo's key design goals are independence of a particular
             index/date/time class and consistency with with ts and 
             base R by providing methods to extend standard generics.
