Author: Jing hua Zhao in collaboration with other colleagues, and with

Depends: haplo.score
Description: This is an integrated package for genetic data analysis
        of both population and family data. Currently it contains
        functions for sample size calculations of both population-based
        and family-based designs, probability of familial disease
        aggregation, kinship calculation, some statistics in linkage
        analysis, and association analysis involving one or more
        genetic markers including haplotype analysis. In the future
        it will incorporate programs for path and segregation analyses,
        as well as other statistics in linkage and association analyses.
License: Programs included in this package by Jing hua Zhao will be
        under GPL. Specific requirement may be possible for programs
        written by other authors.
