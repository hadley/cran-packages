Description: Package for Bayesian Model Averaging in linear models
        using stochastic or deterministic sampling without replacement
        from posterior distributions. Prior distributions on
        coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors
        corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the Liang et
        al hyper-g priors (to appear JASA 2008). Other model selection
        criterian include AIC and BIC. Sampling probabilities may be
        updated based on the sampled models. Allows uniform or
        beta-binomial prior distributions on models.
