Description: Collection of econometric functions for performance and
        risk analysis. This package aims to aid practitioners and
        researchers in utilizing the latest research in analysis of
        non-normal return streams.  In general, it is most tested on
        return (rather than price) data on a regular scale, but most
        functions will work with irregular return data as well, and
        increasing numbers of functions will work with P&L or price
        data where possible.
Depends: R (>= 2.14.0), zoo, xts (>= 0.8)
Suggests: Hmisc, MASS, tseries, quadprog, sn, robustbase, quantreg,
        gplots, ff
