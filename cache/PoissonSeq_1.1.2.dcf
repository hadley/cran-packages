Description: This package implements a method for normalization,
        testing, and false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing
        data. The description of the method is in Li J, Witten DM,
        Johnstone I, Tibshirani R (2012). Normalization, testing, and
        false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing data.
        Biostatistics 13(3): 523-38. We estimate the sequencing depths
        of experiments using a new method based on Poisson
        goodness-of-fit statistic, calculate a score statistic on the
        basis of a Poisson log-linear model, and then estimate the
        false discovery rate using a modified version of permutation
        plug-in method. A more detailed instruction as well as sample
        data is available at
        http://www.stanford.edu/~junli07/research.html.  In this
        version, we changed the way of calculating log foldchange for
        two-class data. The FDR estimation part remains unchanged.
