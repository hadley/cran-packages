Description: A collection of functions for plotting spectra (NMR, IR
        etc) and carrying out various forms of top-down exploratory
        data analysis, such as HCA, PCA and model-based clustering.
        The design allows comparison of data from samples which fall
        into groups such as treatment vs. control.  Robust methods
        appropriate for this type of high-dimensional data are
        available.  ChemoSpec is designed to be very user friendly and
        suitable for people with limited background in R.
