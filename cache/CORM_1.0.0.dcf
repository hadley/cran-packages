Description: We proposed a new model-based clustering method-the clustering of regression models method, which groups genes that share a similar relationship to the covariate(s). This method provides a unified approach for a family of clustering procedures and can be applied for data collected with various experimental designs. This package includes the implementation for two such clustering procedures: (1) clustering of linear models (CLM), and (2) clustering of linear mixed models (CLMM).
