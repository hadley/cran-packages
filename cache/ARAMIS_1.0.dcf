Description: The ARAMIS package runs the Adaptive Multiple Importance
        Sampler (AMIS) algorithm from Jean-Marie Cornuet, Jean-Michel
        Marin, Antonietta Mira and Christian Robert (2012), Adaptive
        Multiple Importance Sampling, Scandinavian Journal of
        Statistics. The Code is flexible enough to accommodate
        virtually any specification of the target and proposal
        distribution together with any clustering routine for the
        adaptation step and any initialization procedure.
