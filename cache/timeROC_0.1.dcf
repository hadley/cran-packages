Description: Estimation of time-dependent ROC curve and area under time
        dependent ROC curve (AUC) in the presence of censored data,
        with or without competing risks. Confidence intervals of AUCs
        and tests for comparing AUCs of two rival markers measured on
        the same subjects can also be computed, using the
        iid-representation of the AUC estimator.
