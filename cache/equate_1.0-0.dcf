Description: The equate package contains functions for non-IRT equating
        under both random groups and nonequivalent groups with anchor
        test designs. Mean, linear, equipercentile and circle-arc
        equating are supported, as are methods for univariate and
        bivariate presmoothing of score distributions. Specific
        equating methods currently supported include Tucker, Levine
        observed score, Levine true score, Braun/Holland, frequency
        estimation, and chained equating.
