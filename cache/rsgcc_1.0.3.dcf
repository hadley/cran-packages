Description: This package provides functions for calculating
        associations between two genes with different correlation
        methods, including the Gini correlation coefficient (GCC), the
        Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient (PCC), the
        Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient (KCC), the Spearman's
        rank correlation coefficient (SCC) and the Tukey's biweight
        correlation coefficient (BiWt). It can also been implemented to
        perform the correlation and clustering analysis of
        transcriptomic data profiled by microarray and RNA-Seq
        technologies. Additionally, this package can be further applied
        to construct gene co-expression networks (GCNs).
