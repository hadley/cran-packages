Description: Contains functions for mapping risk surfaces using
        individual-level data such as case-control study data, using
        generalized additive models (GAMs) to smooth over
        two-dimensional location while adjusting for any confounding
        variables.  Includes convenient functions for mapping and
        permutation tests for the null hypothesis that spatial location
        is not associated with risk (adjusting for confounders).
