Title: High-level R Interface to NetCDF Datasets
Author:  Juerg Schmidli
Maintainer: Juerg Schmidli <juerg.schmidli@env.ethz.ch>
Depends: R (>= 1.7), RNetCDF
Description: This package provides a high-level R interface to Unidata's NetCDF
    data files. Using this package netCDF datasets, and all their
    associated metadata, can be read and written in one go. It is also
    easy to create datasets including lots of metadata.
    This package supports both the CF and default NetCDF metadata conventions.
    This package
    supports more general NetCDF files and conventions than the ncdf
    package by David Pierce. It requires the low-level NetCDF package
    RNetCDF by Pavel Michna.
