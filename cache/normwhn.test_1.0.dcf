Title: Normality and White Noise Testing
Version: 1.0
Date: 2010-08-02
Author: Peter Wickham
Maintainer: Peter Wickham <peterwickham@mac.com>
Description: Includes Omnibus Univariate and Multivariate Normality
        Tests (See Doornik and Hansen (1994)). One variation allows for
        the possibility of weak dependence rather than independence in
        the variable(s). Also included is an univariate white noise
        test where the null hypothesis is "white noise" rather than
        strict "white noise".
