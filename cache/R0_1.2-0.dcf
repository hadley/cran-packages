Description: This package is designed to estimate reproduction numbers
        for disease outbreak, based on incidence data. It implements
        several documented methods. It is therefore possible to compare
        estimations according to the methods used. Depending on the
        methods requested by user, basic reproduction number (commonly
        denoted as R0) or real-time reproduction number (referred to as
        R(t)) is computed, along with a 95% Confidence Interval.
        Plotting outputs will give different graphs depending on the
        methods requested : basic reproductive number estimations will
        only show the epidemic curve (collected data) and an adjusted
        model, whereas real-time methods will also show the R(t)
        variations throughout the outbreak time period. Sensitivity
        analysis tools are also provided, and allow for investigating
        effects of varying Generation Time distribution or time window
        on estimates.
