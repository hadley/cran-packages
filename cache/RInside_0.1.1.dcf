Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications The RInside
        packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your C++
        application by providing a few wrapper classes.
 .
 As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build
        of R is required. This works on Linux and OS X, but may not on
        Windows due to the way R is built on Windows.
 .
 Several examples are provided in the examples/ directory of the
        installed package, and Doxygen-generated documentation of the
        C++ classes is included as well.
