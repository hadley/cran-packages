Description: This package provides functions for computing the density and
  the distribution function of, and for generating random vectors from the
  multivariate normal and multivariate t distributions.  It provides functions
  similar in scope to those of the package 'mvtnorm', but with some
  differences; one of these is that probabilities are computed via a
  non-Monte Carlo method.
