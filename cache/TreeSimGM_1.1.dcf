Description: The package is a flexible simulation tool for phylogenetic
        trees under a general model. It is possible to assume any
        probability distribution for the waiting time until speciation
        and extinction independently. Thus, TreeSimGM allows to
        simulate stochastic phylogenetic trees using any probability
        distribution and parameters for speciation and extinction. The
        speciation modes have all binary splits and are: (i) symmetric,
        where for every speciation event new waiting times until
        speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages;
        and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one
        species with new waiting times, and another that carries the
        extinction time and age of its ancestor. Those two modes were
        inspired by allopatric and peripatric speciation
        respectively.Both models (symmetric and asymmetric) were
        created and implemented so that different processes
        (distributions) for speciation and extinction could be
        independently and explicitly specified. It is also possible to
        have an implicit extinction process by setting the extinction
        rate to zero.
