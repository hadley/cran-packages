Description: Collection of ancillary functions and utilities to be used
        in conjunction with the TraMineR package for sequential data
        exploration. Most of the functions are in test phase, lack
        systematic consistency check of the arguments and are subject
        to changes. Once fully checked, some of the functions of this
        collection could be included in a next release of TraMineR.
