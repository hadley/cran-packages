        on genetic differentiation

Description: This package provides functions that allow users to quantify the relative 
	contributions of geographic and ecological distances to empirical patterns of genetic 
	differentiation on a landscape.  Specifically, the package contains a function that 
	calls a custom Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, which is used to estimate 
	the parameters of the inference model, as well as functions for performing MCMC 
	diagnosis and assessing model adequacy.
