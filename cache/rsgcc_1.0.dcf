Description: This package provides functions for calcluating Gini
        correlation coefficient (GCC) and performing GCC-based
        clustering analysis of gene expression data generated from both
        microarray and next-generation sequencing (RNA-Seq)
        technologies. Gini correlation outperforms Pearson correlation
        and Spearman correlation to identify regulatory relationships
        from both microarray and RNA-Seq data. In addtion, GCC has the
        capability of more robustness on non-distribution, less
        sensitivity to outlier data points and higher comatibility to
        RNA-Seq data.
