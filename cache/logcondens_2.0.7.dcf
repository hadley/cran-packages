Description: Given independent and identically distributed observations
        X(1), ..., X(n), this package allows to compute the maximum
        likelihood estimator (MLE) of a density as well as a smoothed
        version of it under the assumption that the density is
        log-concave, see Rufibach (2007) and Duembgen and Rufibach
        (2009). The main function of the package is 'logConDens' that
        allows computation of the log-concave MLE and its smoothed
        version. In addition, we provide functions to compute (1) the
        value of the density and distribution function estimates (MLE
        and smoothed) at a given point (2) the characterizing functions
        of the estimator, (3) to sample from the estimated
        distribution, (5) to compute a two-sample permutation test
        based on log-concave densities, (6) the ROC curve based on
        log-concave estimates within cases and controls, including
        confidence intervals for given values of false positive
        fractions. Finally, three datasets that have been used to
        illustrate log-concave density estimation are made available.
