Description: This package includes functions and data sets to support
        chemical thermodynamic modeling in biochemistry and
        low-temperature geochemistry. The features include calculation
        of the standard molal thermodynamic properties and chemical
        affinities of reactions involving minerals and/or biomolecules;
        a database of thermodynamic properties of aqueous, crystalline
        and gaseous species; amino acid group additivity for the
        standard molal thermodynamic properties of neutral and ionized
        proteins; use of the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations
        of state for aqueous species; construction of equilibrium
        activity diagrams as a function of temperature, pressure, and
        chemical activities or fugacities of basis species.
