Description: Examples for Seamless R and C++ integration The Rcpp
        package contains a C++ library that facilitates the integration
        of R and C++ in various ways. This package provides some usage
        examples.
 .
 Note that the documentation in this package currently does not cover
        all the features in the package. It is not even close.
 .
 It does however provide a few example based on both the (deprecated)
        `classic' API and the current Rcpp API which supercedes it. As
        such, it can help in porting from the older API to the newer
        API.
Depends: R (>= 2.11.0), Rcpp (>= 0.9.9), RcppClassic
