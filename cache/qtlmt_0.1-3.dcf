Title: Tools for mapping multiple complex traits
Author: Riyan Cheng <riyan.cheng@anu.edu.au>
Maintainer: Riyan Cheng <riyan.cheng@anu.edu.au>
Description: This software provides tools for joint analysis of
        multiple traits in a backcross (BC) or recombinant inbred lines
        (RIL) population. It can be used to select an optimal subset of
        traits for multiple-trait mapping, analyze multiple traits via
        the SURE model, which can associate different QTL with
        different traits, and perform multiple-trait composite
        multiple-interval mapping.
