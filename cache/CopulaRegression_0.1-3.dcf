Description: This R-packages presents a bivariate, copula-based model
        for the joint distribution of a pair of continuous and discrete
        random variables. The two marginal random variables are modeled
        via generalized linear models, and their joint distribution
        (represented by a parametric copula family) is estimated using
        maximum-likelihood techniques.
