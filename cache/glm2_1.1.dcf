Title: Fitting Generalized Linear Models
Version: 1.1
Date: 2012-11-21
Author: Ian Marschner (using code from glm and glm.fit in the stats
        package)
Maintainer: Ian Marschner <ian.marschner@mq.edu.au>
Depends: R (>= 2.12.1), stats
Description: Fits generalized linear models using the same model
        specification as glm in the stats package, but with a modified
        default fitting method that provides greater stability for
        models that may fail to converge using glm
