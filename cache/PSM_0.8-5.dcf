Description: This package provides functions for estimation of linear
        and non-linear mixed-effects models using stochastic
        differential equations. Moreover it provides functions for
        finding smoothed estimates of model states and for simulation.
        The package allows for any multivariate non-linear time-variant
        model to be specified, and it also handels multidimentional
        input, co-variates, missing observations and specification of
        dosage regimen.
