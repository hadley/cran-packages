Description: The WeightedCluster library provides functions to cluster
        states sequences and weighted data. These functionalities
        include aggregating replicated cases, an optimized weighted PAM
        algorithm, function computing cluster quality measures for a
        range of clustering solutions and miscellaneous functions to
        plot clustering solutions of state sequences.
