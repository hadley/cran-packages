Description: EcoTroph is an approach and software for modelling marine
        and freshwater ecosystems. It is articulated entirely around
        trophic levels. EcoTroph's key displays are bivariate plots,
        with trophic level as the abscissa, and biomass flows or
        related quantities as ordinate. Thus, trophic ecosystem
        functioning can be modelled as a continuous flow of biomass
        surging up the food web, from lower to higher trophic levels,
        because of predation and ontogenic processes. Such an approach,
        wherein species as such disappear, may be regarded as
        constituting the ultimate stage in the use of the trophic level
        metric for ecosystem modelling, providing a simplified but
        potentially useful caricature of ecosystem functioning and
        impact of fishing.
