Description: Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object. The 
 initial purpose was to create correlation structures that describe 
 family relationships such as kinship and identity-by-descent, which
 can be used to model family data in mixed effects models, such as in the 
 coxme function.  Also includes a tool for pedigree drawing which is 
 focused on producing compact layouts without intervention.  Recent additions
 include utilities to trim the pedigree object with various criteria, and 
 kinship for the X chromosome
