Description: IRT classification uses the probability that candidates of
        a given ability, will answer correctly questions of a specified
        difficulty to calculate the probability of their achieving
        every possible score in a test. Due to the IRT assumption of
        conditional independence (that is every answer given is assumed
        to depend only on the latent trait being measured) the
        probability of candidates achieving these potential scores can
        be expressed by multiplication of probabilities for item
        responses for a given ability. Once the true score and the
        probabilities of achieving all other scores have been
        determined for a candidate the probability of their score lying
        in the same category as that of their true score
        (classification accuracy), or the probability of consistent
        classification in a category over administrations
        (classification consistency), can be calculated.
