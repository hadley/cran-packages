Description: Cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with
        high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) has made it possible to
        identify targeting sites of RNA-binding proteins in various
        cell culture systems and tissue types on a genome-wide scale.
        Here we present MiClip,a novel model-based approach to identify
        high-confidence protein-RNA binding sites in CLIP-Seq datasets.
        This approach assigns confidence value to each binding site on
        a probabilistic basis. The MiClip package can be flexibly
        applied to analyze both HITS-CLIP data and PAR-CLIP data.
