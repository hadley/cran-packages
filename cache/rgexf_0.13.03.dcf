Description: The first R package to work with GEXF graph files (used in
        Gephi and others). Using XML library, it allows the user to
        easily build/read graph files including attributes, GEXF viz
        attributes (such as colour, size, and position), network
        dynamics (for both edges and nodes, including spells) and edges
        weighting. Users can build/handle graphs element-by-element or
        massively through data-frames.
