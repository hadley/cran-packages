Description: Markov-chain Monte Carlo diagnostic plots. The purpose of
        the package is to combine existing tools from the 'coda' and
        'lattice' packages, and make it easy to adjust graphical
        details. It can be useful for anyone using MCMC analysis,
        regardless of the application.
