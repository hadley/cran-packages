Description: The package includes functions to calculate confidence
        intervals for the difference of dependent proportions. There
        are two functions implemented to edit the data (dichotomising
        with the help of cutpoints, counting accordance and discordance
        of two tests or situations). For the calculation of the
        confidence intervals entries of the fourfold table are needed.
