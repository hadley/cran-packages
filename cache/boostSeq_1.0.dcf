Description: This package contains functionality to select a subsample
        of a genotyped cohort e.g. from a GWAS that is preferential for
        resequencing under the assumtion that causal variants share a
        haplotype with the risk allele of associated variants. The
        subsample is selected such that is contains risk alleles at
        maximum frequency for all SNPs specified. Phentoypes can also
        be included as additional variables to obtain a higher fraction
        of extreme phenotypes. An arbitrary number of SNPs and/or
        phentoypes can be specified for enrichment in a single
        subsample.
