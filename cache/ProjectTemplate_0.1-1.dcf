Description: The ProjectTemplate package provides a single function
        create.project() that automatically builds a directory for a
        new R project with a clean directory structure and useful
        utility programs for automating the loading of project data.
        The hope is that standardized and automated data loading,
        automatic loading of best practice packages and useful nudges
        towards keeping cleanly organized code will improve the quality
        of R coding.
