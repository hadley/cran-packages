Title: Fuzzy stationary probabilities from a sequence of observations
        of an unknown Markov chain
Type: Package
Author: Pablo J. Villacorta <pjvi@decsai.ugr.es>
Description: An implementation of a method for computing fuzzy numbers
        representing stationary probabilities of an unknown Markov
        chain, from which a sequence of observations along time has
        been obtained. The algorithm is based on the proposal presented
        by James Buckley in his book on Fuzzy probabilities (Springer,
        2005), chapter 6. Package FuzzyNumbers is used to represent the
        output probabilities.
