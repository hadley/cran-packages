Description: The 'installr' package aims at making the process of
        updating R on Windows as easy as possible, the main function
        for this purpose is the updateR() function. Also, the package
        contains a set of functions allowing users to install new
        software (on Windows OS) using R. While for Linux users, the
        installation process of new software may be just running a
        short line of code, for the regular Windows user it often
        includes browsing online, finding the latest version,
        downloading it, running the installer, and deleting the
        installation file. All of these steps are automatically done
        using functions in this package.
