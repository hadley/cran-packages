Description: The package contains routines to 1) project unity-summed
        triples to unit-square doubles and vice versa, 2) make a grid
        of unity-summed triples paired to doubles, 3) evaluate a
        function over the grid and 4) make simple plots including
        ternary contour plots over a grid of values.
