        occurrence using presence-only data.

Description: Provides a likelihood-based approach to modeling species
        distributions using presence-only data. In contrast to the
        popular software program MAXENT, this approach yields estimates
        of the probability of occurrence, which is a natural descriptor
        of a species' distribution.
