Title: Additiv Two-Way Hazards Modelling of Right Censored Survival Data 
Version: 2.0
Author: Pavel Khomski <pkhomski@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de>
Description: The package offers a fitting of smooth varying coefficients in an additiv two-way hazard model. 
             Nonparametric penalized spline (p-spline) fitting is proposed. 
	     Two alternativ models can be analized. In the first one a non.periodic calender time, like the calender yaer, is considered 
	     as a second time scale (additionaly to the survival time) and as a spline basis truncated polynomial functions are chosen.
	     In the second model a periodic time scale, like a season of year, is additionaly considered and as a spline basis the b-splines
	     are selected.
