Title: The VBMA4hmm (Variational Bayesian Markov Model for hidden
        markov model) package
Author: Stevenn Volant
Maintainer: Stevenn Volant <stevenn.volant@agroparistech.fr>
Description: This package allows one to deal with a 2-states HMM with a
        fixed Gaussian distribution as emission for one state and a
        mixture of Gaussian for the other state. Furthermore, by
        computing optimal variational weights, it calculates an
        averaged estimator of the posterior probabilities.
