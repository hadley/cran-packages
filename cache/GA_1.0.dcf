Title: Genetic Algorithms
Description: An R package for optimization using genetic algorithms.
        The package provides a flexible general-purpose set of tools
        for implementing genetic algorithms search in both the
        continuous and discrete case, whether constrained or not. Users
        can easily define their own objective function depending on the
        problem at hand. Several genetic operators are available and
        can be combined to explore the best settings for the current
        task. Furthermore, users can define new genetic operators and
        easily evaluate their performances.
