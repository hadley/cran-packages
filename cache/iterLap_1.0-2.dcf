Description: The iterLap (iterated Laplace approximation) algorithm
        approximates a general (possibly non-normalized) probability
        density on R^p, by repeated Laplace approximations to the
        difference between current approximation and true density (on
        log scale). The final approximation is a mixture of
        multivariate normal distributions and might be used for example
        as a proposal distribution for importance sampling (eg in
        Bayesian applications).  The algorithm can be seen as a
        computational generalization of the Laplace approximation
        suitable for skew or multimodal densities.
