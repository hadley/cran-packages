Description: This package is version 2 of HydroMe v.1 package. It
        estimates the parameters in infiltration and water retention
        models by curve-fitting method. The models considered are those
        that are commonly used in soil science. It has new models for
        water retention characteristic curve and debugging of errors in
        HydroMe v.1
