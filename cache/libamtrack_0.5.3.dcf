Description: This package is the R interface to the open-source, ANSI C
        library libamtrack (http://libamtrack.dkfz.org). libamtrack
        provides computational routines for the prediction of detector
        response and radiobiological efficiency in heavy charged
        particle beams. It is designed for research in proton and ion
        dosimetry and radiotherapy. libamtrack also provides many
        auxiliary physics routines for proton and ion beams. Original
        package and C-to-R autoconversion routines developed by Felix
        A. Klein.
