Description: It implements many univariate and multivariate permutation
        (and rotation) tests. Allowed tests: the t one and two samples,
        ANOVA, linear models, Chi Squared test, rank tests (i.e.
        Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis), Sign test and McNemar.
        Test on Linear Models are performed also in presence of
        covariates (i.e. nuisance parameters). The permutation and the
        rotation methods to get the null distribution of the test
        statistic(s) are available. It also implements methods for
        multiplicity control such as Westfall-Young min-p procedure and
        Closed Testing (Marcus, 1976).
