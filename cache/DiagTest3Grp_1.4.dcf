Description: The R package provides utilities to estimate and make
        inference on two summary measures for diagnostic tests when
        there are three ordinal groups ----volume under ROC surface
        (VUS) and the extended Youden index, assuming that diagnostic
        markers increase monotonically and stochastically with disease
        severity. Point estimates, variance, confidence interval and
        optimal cut-points both under the normal assumption and also
        the non-parametric method(s) will be provided for the summary
        measures. Statistical tests are implemented to compare multiple
        diagnostic tests and two diagnostic test.  Sample size is
        calculated to estimate the summary measures within a
        user-specified margin of error for future study planning.
