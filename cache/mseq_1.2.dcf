Description: This package implements all the methods in the paper
        "Modeling non-uniformity in short-read rates in RNA-Seq data".
        Especially, it implements both the iterative glm procedure for
        the Poisson linear model and the training procedure of the MART
        model. The cross-validation for both of the methods is also
        implemented. Version 1.1 and later also implements the Poisson
        linear model with dinucleotide composition. Version 1.2
        corrected a bug in expData.R. This bug leads to mis-labeled
        lines in plotCoef.R, but will not change other parts like
        training, testing, or cross-validation.
