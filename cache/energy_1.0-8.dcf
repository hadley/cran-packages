Description: E-statistics (energy) tests for comparing distributions: 
 multivariate normality, multivariate k-sample test for equal distributions, 
 hierarchical clustering by e-distances, multivariate independence test, 
 goodness-of-fit tests. Energy-statistics concept based on a generalization of 
 Newton's potential energy is due to Gabor J. Szekely.
