Description: plyr is a set of tools that solves a common set of
        problems: you need to break a big problem down into manageable
        pieces, operate on each pieces and then put all the pieces back
        together.  For example, you might want to fit a model to each
        spatial location or time point in your study, summarise data by
        panels or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary
        statistics.
