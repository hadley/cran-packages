Title: Non-supervised Regional Frequency Analysis
Author: Alberto Viglione

Depends: stats, graphics
Description: A collection of statistical tools for objective
        (non-supervised) applications of the Regional Frequency
        Analysis methods in hydrology. The package refers to the
        index-value method and, more precisely, helps the hydrologist
        to: (1) regionalize the index-value; (2) form homogeneous
        regions with similar growth curves; (3) fit distribution
        functions to the empirical regional growth curves.
