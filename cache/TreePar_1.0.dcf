Description: For a given phylogeny on present day data (e.g. species or
        viruses), a likelihood method is provided where the maximum
        likelihood speciation and extinction rates are estimated. The
        method accounts for rate changes and mass extinction events:
        Time is split into intervals, and in each interval, the rates
        can be different. Throughout an interval, the rates stay
        constant. At the end of an interval, a pre-defined fraction of
        the extant species becomes extinct. No species becoming extinct
        is a rate shift event without mass extinction. The method
        estimates the maximum likelihood interval sizes, and the
        speciation and extinction rates in each interval. Note that the
        method takes into account the whole phylogeny, in particular it
        accounts for the "pull of the present" effect.
