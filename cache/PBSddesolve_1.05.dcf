Description: This package solves systems of delay differential equations. 
  by interfacing numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood 
  <s.wood _at_ bath.ac.uk>, with contributions by Benjamin J. Cairns 
  <ben.cairns@bristol.ac.uk>. These numerical routines first appeared 
  in Simon Wood's solv95 program.
  This package includes a vignette and a complete user's guide. 
  'PBSddesolve' originally appeared on CRAN under the name 'ddesolve'.
  That version is no longer supported. The current name emphasizes a close 
  association with other PBS packages, particularly 'PBSmodelling'.
