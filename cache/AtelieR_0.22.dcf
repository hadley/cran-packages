Description: A collection of statistical simulation and computation tools with a GTK GUI, to help teach statistical concepts and compute probabilities. Two domains are covered: I. Understanding (Central-Limit Theorem and the Normal Distribution, Distribution of a sample mean, Distribution of a sample variance, Probability calculator for common distributions), and II. Elementary Bayesian Statistics (bayesian inference on proportions, contingency tables, means and variances, with informative and noninformative priors).
