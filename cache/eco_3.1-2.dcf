Description: eco is a publicly available R package that implements the
  Bayesian and likelihood methods proposed in Imai, Lu, and Strauss 
  (2008) for ecological inference in $2 \times 2$ tables as
  well as the method of bounds introduced by Duncan and Davis (1953). 
  The package fits both parametric and nonparametric models using 
  either the Expectation-Maximization algorithms (for likelihood
  models) or the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (for Bayesian 
  models).  For all models, the individual-level data can be directly 
  incorporated into the estimation whenever such data are available. 
  Along with in-sample and out-of-sample predictions, the package also 
  provides a functionality which allows one to quantify the effect of data
  aggregation on parameter estimation and hypothesis testing under the
  parametric likelihood models.
