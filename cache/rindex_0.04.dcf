Version: 0.04
Date: 2007-08-02
Author: Jens Oehlschlägel <Jens_Oehschlaegel@truecluster.com>
Maintainer: Jens Oehlschlägel <Jens_Oehschlaegel@truecluster.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.5.1), regtest
Description: Index structures allow quickly accessing elements from large collections. 
  While btree are optimized for disk databases and ttree for ram databases we use hybrid static indexing which is quite optimal for R.
License: GPL2-QA (like GPL2 but requires users to participate in Quality Assurance aka Regression Testing, details to be defined)
