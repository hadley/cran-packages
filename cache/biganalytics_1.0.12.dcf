        analytics. Functions bigkmeans and binit may also be used with
        native R objects. For tapply-like functions, the bigtabulate
        package may also be helpful. For linear algebra support, see
        bigalgebra.  For mutex (locking) support for advanced
        shared-memory usage, see synchronicity.
