Description: A collection of functions for computing centrographic
        statistics (e.g., standard distance, standard deviation
        ellipse, standard deviation box) for observations taken at
        point locations. Separate plotting functions have been
        developed for each measure. Users interested in writing results
        to ESRI shapefiles can do so by using results from aspace
        functions as inputs to the convert.to.shapefile and
        write.shapefile functions in the shapefiles library. The aspace
        library was originally conceived to aid in the analysis of
        spatial patterns of travel behaviour (see Buliung and Remmel,
        2008). Major changes in the current version include (1) removal
        of dependencies on several external libraries (e.g., gpclib,
        maptools, sp), (2) the separation of plotting and estimation
        capabilities, (3) reduction in the number of functions, and (4)
        expansion of analytical capabilities with additional functions
        for descriptive analysis and visualization (e.g., standard
        deviation box, centre of minimum distance, central feature).
