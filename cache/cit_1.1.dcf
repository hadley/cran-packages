Description: This package implements a formal statistical hypothesis
        test, resulting in a p-value, to quantify uncertainty in a
        causal inference pertaining to a measured factor, e.g. a
        molecular species, which potentially mediates a known causal
        association between a locus and a quantitative trait. The test
        is applicable to data that includes genotype (discrete),
        possible causal mediator such as gene expression (continuous)
        and an outcome of interest (continuous).
