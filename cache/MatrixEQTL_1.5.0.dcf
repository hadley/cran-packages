Description: Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large
        datasets.  Matrix eQTL can test for association between
        genotype and gene expression using linear regression with
        either additive or ANOVA genotype effects.  The models can
        include covariates to account for factors as population
        stratification, gender, and clinical variables.  It also
        supports models with heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors,
        false discovery rate estimation and separate treatment of local
        (cis) and distant (trans) eQTLs.
