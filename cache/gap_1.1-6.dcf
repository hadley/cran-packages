Description: It is designed as an integrated package for genetic data
        analysis of both population and family data. Currently, it
        contains functions for sample size calculations of both
        population-based and family-based designs, probability of
        familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation, some
        statistics in linkage analysis, and association analysis
        involving one or more genetic markers including haplotype
        analysis with or without environmental covariates.
