Title: Simpler use of data mining methods (e.g. NN and SVM) in
        classification and regression.

Description: This package facilitates the use of data mining algorithms
        in classification and regression tasks by presenting a short
        and coherent set of functions. While several DM algorithms can
        be used, it is particularly suited for Neural Networks (NN) and
        Support Vector Machines (SVM).
