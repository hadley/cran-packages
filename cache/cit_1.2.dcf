Description: This package implements a formal statistical hypothesis test, resulting in a p-value, to quantify uncertainty in a causal inference pertaining to a measured factor, e.g. a molecular species, which potentially mediates a known causal association between a locus and a quantitative trait. The test is applicable to data that includes genotype (discrete), possible causal mediator such as gene expression (continuous) and an outcome of interest (continuous).
