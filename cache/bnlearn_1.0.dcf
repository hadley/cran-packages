Description: Bayesian network structure learning
  via constraint-based (also known as 'conditional
  independence') and score-based algorithms.
  This package implements the Grow-Shrink (GS)
  algorithm, the Incremental Association (IAMB)
  algorithm, the Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB)
  algorithm, the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB) algorithm
  and the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search
  algorithm for both discrete and gaussian networks,
  along with many score functions and conditional
  independence tests.
  Some utility functions (model comparison and
  manipulation, random data generation, arc
  orientation testing) are also included.
