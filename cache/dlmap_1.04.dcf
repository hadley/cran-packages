Title: Detection Localization Mapping for QTL
Version: 1.04

Author: Emma Huang and Andrew George
Maintainer: Emma Huang <Emma.Huang@csiro.au>
Description: QTL mapping in a mixed model framework with separate
        detection and localization stages. The first stage detects the
        number of QTL on each chromosome based on the genetic variation
        due to grouped markers on the chromosome; the second stage uses
        this information to determine the most likely QTL positions.
        The mixed model can accommodate general fixed and random
        effects, including spatial effects in field trials and pedigree
        effects. Applicable to backcrosses, doubled haploids,
        recombinant inbred lines, F2 intercrosses, and association
        mapping populations.
