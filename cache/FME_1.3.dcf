Description: Provides functions to help in fitting models to data, to
        perform Monte Carlo, sensitivity and identifiability analysis.
        It is intended to work with models be written as a set of
        differential equations that are solved either by an integration
        routine from package deSolve, or a steady-state solver from
        package rootSolve. However, the methods can also be used with
        other types of functions.
