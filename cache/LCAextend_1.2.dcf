Description: This package performs a Latent Class Analysis of
        phenotypic measurements in pedigrees and a model selection
        based on one of two methods: likelihood-based cross-validation
        and Bayesian Information Criterion. It computes also individual
        and triplet child-parents weights in a pedigree using an
        upward-downward algorithm. It takes into account the familial
        dependence defined by the pedigree structure by considering
        that a class of a child depends on his parents classes via
        triplet-transition probabilities of the classes. The package
        handles the case where measurements are available on all
        subjects and the case where measurements are available only on
        symptomatic (i.e. affected) subjects. Distributions for
        discrete (or ordinal) and continuous data are currently
        implemented. The package can deal with missing data.
