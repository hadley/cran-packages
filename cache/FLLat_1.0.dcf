Description: Fits the Fused Lasso Latent Feature model, which is used
        for modeling multi-sample aCGH data to identify regions of copy
        number variation (CNV).  Produces a set of features that
        describe the patterns of CNV and a set of weights that describe
        the composition of each sample.  Also provides functions for
        choosing the optimal tuning parameters and the appropriate
        number of features.
