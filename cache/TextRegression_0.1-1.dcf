Description: Predict continuous valued outputs associated
    with text documents. The input corpus of text documents
    is transformed into a document-term matrix (DTM) and
    then a regularized linear regression is fit that uses
    this matrix as predictors to predict the continuous
    valued output. The corpus's terms, coefficients for all
    terms and an estimate of the model's predictive power
    are returned in a list.
