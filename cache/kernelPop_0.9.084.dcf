Description: This package creates a individual-based population genetic simulation.  Individuals have spatial coordiantes, dispersal governed by mixtures of Weibull and normal pdfs.  It is discrete-time.  It can be arbitrarily complex given enough known or assumed demographic characteristics.  Simulates diploid and haploid inheritance. Allows the development of null distributions of genotypes for complex demographic scenarios.
