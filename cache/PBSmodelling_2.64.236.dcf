Description: PBS Modelling provides software to facilitate the design,
        testing, and operation of computer models. It focuses
        particularly on tools that make it easy to construct and edit a
        customized graphical user interface (GUI). Although it depends
        heavily on the R interface to the Tcl/Tk package, a user does
        not need to know Tcl/Tk. The package contains examples that
        illustrate models built with other R packages, including
        PBSmapping, deSolve, PBSddesolve, and BRugs.  It also serves as
        a convenient prototype for building new R packages, along with
        instructions and batch files to facilitate that process.  The R
        directory '.../library/PBSmodelling/doc' includes a complete
        user guide PBSmodelling-UG.pdf. To use this package
        effectively, please consult the guide.
