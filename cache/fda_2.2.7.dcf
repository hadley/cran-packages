Description: These functions were developed to support functional data
        analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W.
        (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were
        ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An
        introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and
        Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and
        Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script
        files working many examples including all but one of the 76
        figures in this latter book. The principal changes to version
        2.2.6 are: 1.  Major enhancements to function smooth.basis as
        well as the functions that call it.  New or revised arguments
        are: "wtvec" may now be a positive symmetric matrix as well as
        a vector "covariates" for inputting covariate matrices that
        explain some fraction of the data to be smoothed (often called
        "semiparametric smoothing") "method=qr" enables an algorithm
        based on the qr- decomposition that will be more accurate than
        the usual approach relying on the Choleski decomposition. It
        will, however, be slower. 2.  Greatly expanded examples in the
        smooth.basis.Rd file that show a wider range of uses of this
        function. 3.  Function data2fd has been replaced by function
        Data2fd for simple smoothing problems.  Data2fd is designed to
        be invoked with various argument configurations. 4.  And the
        usual fixes of reported bugs, especially in the registraton
        functions, landmarkreg and register.fd.
