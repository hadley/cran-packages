Description: A group of sample points are evaluted against a
        user-defined expression, the sample points are lists of
        parameters with values that may be substituted into that
        expression. The genetic algorithm attmepts to make the result
        of the expression as low as possible (usually this would be the
        sum of residuals squared).
