Description: This package provides methods for estimation and
        hypothesis testing of proportions in group testing designs. It
        involves methods for estimating a proportion in a single
        population (assuming sensitivity and specificty 1 in designs
        with equal group sizes), as well as hypothesis tests and
        functions for experimental design for this situation. For
        estimating one proportion or the difference of proportions, a
        number of confidence interval methods are included, which can
        deal with various different pool sizes. Further, regression
        methods are implemented for simple pooling and matrix pooling
        designs.
