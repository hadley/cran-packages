Description: Performs the Quine-McCluskey algorithm for Qualitative Comparative Analysis, as described in Ragin, Charles C. 1987 "The Comparative Method. Moving beyond qualitative and quantitative strategies", Berkeley: University of California Press. It currently handles about 8 conditions and one outcome. While theoretically it could handle more conditions, 	it requires a lot of computer resources and is memory hungry; future versions will have more functions to address this problem.
