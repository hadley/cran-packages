Description: muscor is a package that solves a number of convex/non-convex sparse regularization formulations for regression or binary classification using multi-stage convex relaxation algorithm, described in the paper "Multi-stage Convex Relaxation for Learning with Sparse Regularization". Loss functions include least squares, logistic, truncated ls/huber. Regularization conditions include Lp + L2 (p in (0,1]), or capped-L1.
