Description: Bayesian quantile regression using the asymmetric Laplace
        distribution, both continuous as well as binary dependent
        variables are supported. The package consists of
        implementations of the methods of Yu & Moyeed (2001), Benoit &
        Van den Poel (2012) and Al-Hamzawi, Yu & Benoit (2012). To
        speed up the calculations, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo core of
        all algorithms is programmed in Fortran and called from R.
