Description: The basic principle driving fractal generation of time
        series is that data is generated iteratively based on
        increasing levels of resolution.  The initial series is defined
        by a so-called initiator pattern and then generators are used
        to replace each segment of the initial pattern. Regular,
        repeatable patterns can be produced by using the same seed and
        generators.  By using a set of generators, non-repeatable time
        series can be produced.  This technique is the basis of the
        fractal time series process in this package.
