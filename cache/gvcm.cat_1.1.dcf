Description: The function fits generalized linear models with
        categorial effects and categorial effect modifiers. The model
        is specified by giving a symbolic description of the linear
        predictor and a description of the error distribution.
        Estimation employs regularization and model selection
        strategies to fuse and/or select a covariate's categories.
        These strategies are either a penalty combining the fused and
        the pure Lasso or a forward selection strategy employing
        AIC/BIC.
