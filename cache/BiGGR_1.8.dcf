Description: This package provides an interface to simulate metabolic
        reconstruction from the BiGG database(http://bigg.ucsd.edu/).
        The package aids in performing flux balance analysis (FBA) on
        the similar lines of the COBRA
        toolbox(http://systemsbiology.ucsd.edu/Downloads/Cobra_Toolbox)
        but with the added value of visualizing the results in the form
        of a metabolic network using the graphviz framework.
