Description: The package performs cluster analysis via kernel density
        estimation. Clusters are associated to the maximally connected
        components with estimated density above a threshold.
        Diagnostics methods for evaluating the quality of clustering
        are also available.  The package includes also a routine to
        estimate the probability density function by the kernel method,
        given a set of data with arbitrary dimensions.
