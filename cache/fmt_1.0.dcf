Description: This package computes posterior residual variances to be
        used in the denominator of a moderated t-statistic from a
        linear model analysis of microarray data.  It is an extension
        of the moderated t-statistic original proposed by Smyth (2004).
        LOESS local regression and empirical Bayesian method are used
        to estimate gene specific prior degrees of freedom and prior
        variance based on average gene intensity level. The posterior
        residual variance in the denominator is a weighted average of
        prior and residual variance and the weights are prior degrees
        of freedom and residual variance degrees of freedom. The
        degrees of freedom of the moderated t-statistic is simply the
        sum of prior and residual variance degrees of freedom.
