Title: Gaussian Mixture Modeling algorithms. Including the belief-based
        mixture modeling.

Description: The bgmm package implements two partially supervised
        mixture modeling methods: soft-label and belief-based modeling.
        For completeness, we equipped the package also with the
        functionality of unsupervised, semi- and fully supervised
        mixture modeling.  The package can be applied also to selection
        of the best-fitting from a set of models with different
        component numbers or constraints on their structures.
