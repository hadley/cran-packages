Description: R interface to CPLEX solvers for linear, quadratic, and
        (linear and quadratic) mixed integer programs. A working
        installation of CPLEX is required for usage of the Rcplex
        package. See the file "INSTALL" for details on how to install
        the Rcplex package in Linux/Unix-like systems and Windows
        systems. Support for sparse matrices is provided by an S3-style
        class "simple_triplet_matrix" from package slam and by objects
        from the Matrix package class hierarchy.
