Description: This package contains R-functions to perform power
        calculation in a group sequential clinical trial with censored
        survival data and possibly unequal patient allocation between
        treatment and control groups. The fuctions can also be used to
        determine the study duration in a clinical trial with censored
        survival data as the sum of the accrual duration, which
        determines the sample size in a traditional sense, and the
        follow-up duration, which more or less controls the number of
        events to be observed. This package also contains R functions
        and methods to display the computed results.
