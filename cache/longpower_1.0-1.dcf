Description: The longpower package contains functions for computing
        power and sample size for linear models of longitudinal data
        based on the formula due to Liu and Liang (1997) and Diggle et
        al (2002). Either formula is expressed in terms of marginal
        model or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) parameters.
        This package contains functions which translate pilot mixed
        effect model parameters (e.g. random intercept and/or slope)
        into marginal model parameters so that the formulas of Diggle
        et al or Liu and Liang formula can be applied to produce sample
        size calculations for two sample longitudinal designs assuming
        known variance.
