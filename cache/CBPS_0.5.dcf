Description: CBPS is an R package that implements the covariate
        balancing propensity score proposed by Imai and Ratkovic (2013;
        JRSSB). The propensity score is estimated such that it
        maximizes the resulting covariate balance as well as the
        prediction of treatment assignment. The method, therefore,
        avoids an iteration between model fitting and balance checking.
        The package also implements several extensions of the CBPS
        beyond the cross-sectional, binary treatment setting.  The
        current version implements the CBPS for longitudinal settings
        so that it can be used in conjunction with marginal structural
        models (Imai and Ratkovic, 2013a) as well as to three- and
        four-valued treatment variables (Fong, 2013). In the future it
        will be extended to other settings including continuous
        treatments and the generalization of experimental and
        instrumental variable estimates.
