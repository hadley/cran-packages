Description: This software has evolved from fisheries research
        conducted at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo,
        British Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language to include
        two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly
        available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).  Embedded C
        code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
        finding polygons that contain specified point events or
        converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse
        Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  Additionally, we include C code
        developed by Alan Murta for the General Polygon Clipper (GPC)
        library (C) Copyright 1997-2012, Advanced Interfaces Group,
        University of Manchester.  PBSmapping also includes data for a
        global shoreline and other data sets in the public domain.  The
        R directory '.../library/PBSmapping/doc' offers a complete
        user's guide PBSmapping-UG.pdf, which should be consulted to
        use all functions in the package effectively.
