Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report
        (2006).  Includes a function for conveniently defining
        differential equation models, model solution based on
        eigenvalues if possible or using numerical solvers and a choice
        of the optimisation methods made available by the FME package
        (default is a Levenberg-Marquardt variant).  Please note that
        no warranty is implied for correctness of results or fitness
        for a particular purpose.
Depends: FME, deSolve, kinfit
