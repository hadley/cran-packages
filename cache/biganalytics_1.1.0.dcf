Description: This package extends the bigmemory package with various
        analytics.  Functions bigkmeans and binit may also be used with
        native R objects.  For tapply-like functions, the bigtabulate
        package may also be helpful.  For linear algebra support, see
        bigalgebra.  For mutex (locking) support for advanced
        shared-memory usage, see synchronicity.
