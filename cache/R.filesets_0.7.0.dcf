Description: A file set refers to a set of files located in one or more
        directories on the file system.  This package provides classes
        and methods to locate, setup, subset, navigate and iterate
        suchs sets.  The API is designed such that these classes can be
        subsetted to provide a richer API for special file formats.
        Moreover, a specific name format is defined such that filenames
        and directories can be considered to have fullnames which
        consists of a name followed by comma-separated tags.  This adds
        additional flexibility to identify file sets and individual
        files.  NOTE: This package's API should be considered to be in
        an beta stage.  Its main purpose is currently to support the
        aroma.* packages, where it is one of the main core components;
        if you decide to build on top of this package, please contact
        the author first.
