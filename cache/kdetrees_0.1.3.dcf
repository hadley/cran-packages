Description: Given a set of phylogenetic trees on a group of taxa (for example
    trees based on individual gene sequences), we present a method for
    identifying a subset of trees which are discordant with the other trees in
    the set. These discordant trees may arise from either biologically
    interesting phenomena (horizontal gene transfers, for example) or more
    mundane sequencing or annotation errors.
