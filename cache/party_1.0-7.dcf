Description: A computational toolbox for recursive partitioning.  The
        core of the package is ctree(), an implementation of
        conditional inference trees which embed tree-structured
        regression models into a well defined theory of conditional
        inference procedures. This non-parametric class of regression
        trees is applicable to all kinds of regression problems,
        including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as
        multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement
        scales of the covariates.  Based on conditional inference
        trees, cforest() provides an implementation of Breiman's random
        forests. The function mob() implements an algorithm for
        recursive partitioning based on parametric models (e.g. linear
        models, GLMs or survival regression) employing parameter
        instability tests for split selection. Extensible functionality
        for visualizing tree-structured regression models is available.
