Description: Calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties
        and chemical affinities of reactions between and among
        minerals, inorganic, organic, and/or biomolecular aqueous and
        crystalline species. Incorporation of an extensive database of
        thermodynamic properties of species and algorithms for
        computing the standard thermodynamic properties of neutral and
        ionized proteins from amino acid group contributions.
        Generation of chemical speciation and predominance diagrams for
        stable and metastable equilibrium in open systems as a function
        of temperature, pressure, and chemical activities or fugacities
        of basis species.
