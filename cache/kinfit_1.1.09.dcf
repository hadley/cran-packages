Description: Simple calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics
        Report (2006). Only kinetic models for parent only datasets are
        included (no metabolite formation/decline or multicompartment
        kinetics).  Please note that no warranty is implied for
        correctness of results or fitness for a particular purpose.
