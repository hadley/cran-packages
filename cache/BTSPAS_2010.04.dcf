Description: BTSPAS provides advanced Bayesian methods to estimate
        abundance and run-timing from temporally-stratified Petersen
        mark-recapture experiments. Methods include hierarchical
        modelling of the capture probabilities and spline smoothing of
        the daily run size.

        R2WinBUGS or BRugs support other platforms/OS types at this
        moment.)
