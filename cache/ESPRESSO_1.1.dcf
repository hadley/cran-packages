Description: The package allows for the Estimation of Sample-size and
        Power by Exploring Simulated Study Outcomes. It supports
        simulation-based power calculation for stand-alone case-control
        studies and for case-control analyses nested in cohort studies,
        that take account of realistic assessment error.
