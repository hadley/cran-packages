Description: The primary aim of MasterBayes is to use MCMC techniques
        to integrate over uncertainty in pedigree configurations
        estimated from molecular markers and phenotypic data.  Emphasis
        is put on the marginal distribution of parameters that relate
        the phenotypic data to the pedigree. All simulation is done in
        compiled C++ for efficency.
