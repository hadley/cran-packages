Description: The ProjectTemplate package provides a function,
        create.project(), that automatically builds a directory for a
        new R project with a clean sub-directory structure and
        automatic data and library loading tools. The hope is that
        standardized data loading, automatic importing of best practice
        packages, integrated unit testing and useful nudges towards
        keeping a cleanly organized codebase will improve the quality
        of R coding.
