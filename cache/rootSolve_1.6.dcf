Description: Routines to find the root of nonlinear functions, and to
        perform steady-state and equilibrium analysis of ordinary
        differential equations (ODE). Includes routines that: (1)
        generate gradient and Jacobian matrices (full and banded), (2)
        find roots of non-linear equations by the Newton-Raphson
        method, (3) estimate steady-state conditions of a system of
        (differential) equations in full, banded or sparse form, using
        the Newton-Raphson method, or by dynamically running, (4) solve
        the steady-state conditions for uni-and multicomponent 1-D,
        2-D, and 3-D partial differential equations, that have been
        converted to ODEs by numerical differencing (using the
        method-of-lines approach). Includes fortran code.
