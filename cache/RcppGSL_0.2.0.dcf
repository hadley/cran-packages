Description: Rcpp integration for GNU GSL vectors and matrices The GNU
        Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of numerical routines
        for scientific computing. It is particularly useful for C and
        C++ programs as it provides a standard C interface to a wide
        range of mathematical routines such as special functions,
        permutations, combinations, fast fourier transforms,
        eigensystems, random numbers, quadrature, random distributions,
        quasi-random sequences, Monte Carlo integration, N-tuples,
        differential equations, simulated annealing, numerical
        differentiation, interpolation, series acceleration, Chebyshev
        approximations, root-finding, discrete Hankel transforms
        physical constants, basis splines and wavelets.  There are over
        1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.
 .
 The RcppGSL package provides an easy-to-use interface between GSL data
        structures and R using concepts from Rcpp which is itself a
        package that eases the interfaces between R and C++.
 .
 This package also serves as a prime example of how to build a package
        that uses Rcpp to connect to anoother third-party library. The
        autoconf script, inline plugin and example package can all be
        used as a stanza to write a similar package against another
        library.
