Description: clusterCons is a package containing functions that
        generate robustness measures for clusters and cluster
        membership based on generating consensus matrices from
        bootstrapped clustering experiments in which a random
        proportion of rows of the data set are used in each individual
        clustering. This allows the user to prioritise clusters and the
        members of clusters based on their consistency in this regime.
        The functions allow the user to select several algorithms to
        use in the re-sampling scheme and with any of the parameters
        that the algorithm would normally take.
