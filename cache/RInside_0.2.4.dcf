Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications The RInside
        packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your C++
        application by providing a few wrapper classes.
 .
 As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build
        of R is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows
        provided you use the same tools used to build R itself.  (NB:
        Windows versions curretly seg.fault and debugging help would be
        appreciated. An older version worked fine, but there may have
        been some Rcpp changes which caused this.)
 .
 Numerous examples are provided in the three subdirectories the
        examples/ directory of the installed package: standard, mpi
        (for parallel computing) and qt (showing how to embed RInside
        inside a Qt application).
 .
 Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++ classes is available at the
        RInside website as well.
