Description: Four methods for mediation analysis with missing data:
        Listwise deletion, Pairwise deletion, Multiple imputation, and
        Two Stage Maximum Likelihood algorithm. For MI and TS-ML,
        auxiliary variables can be included. Bootstrap confidence
        intervals for mediation effects are obtained. The robust method
        is also implemented for TS-ML.
