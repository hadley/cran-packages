Description: Unbiased recursive partitioning in a conditional 
  inference framework. This package implements a unified
  framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured 
  regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference 
  procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures 
  are implemented. The methodology is applicable to all kinds of 
  regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored 
  as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement 
  scales of the covariates. Extensible functionality for visualizing
  tree-structured regression models is available.
