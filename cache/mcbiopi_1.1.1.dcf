Description: Computes the prime implicants or a minimal disjunctive normal form for a
  logic expression presented by a truth table or a logic tree. Has been particularly 
  developed for logic expressions resulting from a logic regression analysis, i.e.
  logic expressions typically consisting of up to 16 literals, where the prime implicants 
  are typically composed of a maximum of 4 or 5 literals.
