Description: This package contains some functions for converting R
        objects to Java style variables and XML. Generated Java code is
        interpretable by dynamic Java libraries such as Beanshell.
        Calling R externally and handling the Java or XML output is an
        other way to call R from other languages without native
        interfaces. For a Java implemantion of this approach visit
