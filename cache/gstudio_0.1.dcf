Description: This package was created to support population genetics
        and landscape genetic courses I teach at Virginia Commonwealth
        University.  This package contains classes and functions for
        the analysis of marker data to include structure statistics,
        analyses based upon allele frequencies, and the Population
        Graphs network analysis of spatial conditional genetic
        covariance.
