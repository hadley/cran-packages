Description: Fits models for genotypic disequilibria, as described in
        Huttley and Wilson (2000), Weir (1996) and Weir and Wilson
        (1986).  Contrast terms are available that account for first
        order interactions between loci.  Also implements, for a single
        locus in a single population, a conditional exact test for
        Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
