Description: r2stl, R package for visualizing data using a 3D printer
        Package r2stl converts R data to STL (stereolithography) files
        that can be used to feed a 3-dimensional printer.  The
        3-dimensional output from an R function can be materialized
        into a solid surface in a plastic material, therefore allowing
        more detailed examination. There are many possible uses for
        this new R tool, such as to examine mathematical expressions
        with very irregular shapes, to aid teaching people with
        impaired vision, to create raised relief maps from digital
        elevation maps (DEMs), to bridge the gap between mathematical
        tools and rapid prototyping, and many more.  Ian Walker created
        the function "r2stl" and Jose' Gama assembled the package.
