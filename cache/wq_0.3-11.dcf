Description: Functions to assist in the processing and exploration of data from
    environmental monitoring programs. The name "wq" stands for "water quality" 
    and reflects the original focus on time series data for physical and 
    chemical properties of water, as well as the plankton. The package is 
    intended for programs that sample approximately monthly at discrete 
    stations, a feature of many legacy data sets. Most of the functions should 
    be useful for analysis of similar-frequency time series regardless of the 
    subject matter.
Depends: methods, R (>= 3.0.0), zoo
Suggests: ggplot2 (>= 0.9), grid, reshape2
