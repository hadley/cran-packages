Title: Distributed Storage and List
Description: A package providing functions and methods for handling
        distributed storage (DStorage) and lists (DLlist). It
        implements an abstract DList class for storing large list-type
        objects in a distributed manner. In doing so it uses a well
        defined storage backend implemented based on the DStorage
        class. It allows for processing such DLists on distributed
        systems efficiently.
