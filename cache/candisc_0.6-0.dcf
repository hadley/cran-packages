Description: This package includes functions for computing and
        visualizing generalized canonical discriminant analyses for a
        multivariate linear model.  Traditional canonical discriminant
        analysis is restricted to a one-way MANOVA design and is
        equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of
        quantitative response variables and a set of dummy variables
        coded from the factor variable.  The candisc package
        generalizes this to multi-way MANOVA designs for all factors in
        a multivariate linear model, computing canonical scores and
        vectors for each term. The graphic functions provide low-rank
        (1D, 2D, 3D) visualizations of terms in an mlm via the
        plot.candisc and heplot.candisc methods.
