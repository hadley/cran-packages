Description: The (C)orrelated (RA)ndom (W)alk (L)ibrary of R functions
        was designed for fitting continuous-time correlated random walk
        (CTCRW) models with time indexed covariates. The model is fit
        using the Kalman-Filter on a state space version of the
        continuous-time staochistic movement process.
