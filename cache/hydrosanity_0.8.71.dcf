Description: Hydrosanity provides a graphical user interface for exploring hydrological
  time series. It is designed to work with catchment surface hydrology data 
  (rainfall and streamflow); but it could also be used with other time series 
  data. Hydrological time series typically have many missing values, and varying 
  accuracy of measurement (indicated by data quality codes). Furthermore, the 
  spatial coverage of data varies over time. Much of the functionality of this 
  package attempts to understand these complex data-sets, detect errors and 
  characterise sources of uncertainty. The emphasis is on graphical methods.
  Hydrosanity's Graphical User Interface was based on Rattle by Graham Williams.
