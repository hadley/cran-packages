Description: This package provides some basic infrastructure and tools
        to fit Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) via penalized
        likelihood inference. Estimating procedures already implemented
        are the LQA algorithm (that is where its name come from),
        P-IRLS, RidgeBoost, GBlockBoost and ForwardBoost.
