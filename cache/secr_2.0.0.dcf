Description: Functions to estimate the density of a spatially
        distributed animal population sampled with an array of passive
        detectors, such as traps, or by searching polygons or
        transects. Models incorporating distance-dependent detection
        are fitted by maximizing the likelihood. Tools are included for
        data manipulation and model selection.
