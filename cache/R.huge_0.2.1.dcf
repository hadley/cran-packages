Title: Methods for accessing huge amounts of data [DEPRECATED]
Author: Henrik Bengtsson <henrikb@braju.com>
Maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson <henrikb@braju.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), R.oo (>= 1.7.3), R.utils (>= 1.5.7)
Description: THIS PACKAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. Do not start building
        new projects based on it. Cross-platform alternatives are the
        following packages: bigmemory (CRAN), ff (CRAN), BufferedMatrix
        (BioConductor).  The main usage of it was inside the
        aroma.affymetrix package. (The package currently provides a
        class representing a matrix where the actual data is stored in
        a binary format on the local file system.  This way the size
        limit of the data is set by the file system and not the
        memory.)
