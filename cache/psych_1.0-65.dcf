Description: A number of routines for personality, psychometrics and experimental
        psychology.   Functions are primarily for scale construction using factor analysis, cluster analysis and
        reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive
        statistics. Functions for simulating particular item and test structures are included. Several functions serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling.  For more information, see the personality-project.org/r.
