Description: The Rcpp package contains a C++ library that facilitates
        the integration of R and C++ in various ways via a rich API.
        This API was preceded by an earlier version which has been
        deprecated since 2010 (but is still supported to provide
        backwards compatability in the package RcppClassic).  This
        package RcppClassicExamples provides usage examples for the
        older, deprecated API. There is also a corresponding package
        RcppExamples package with examples for the newer, current API
        which we strongly recommend as the basis for all new
        development.
Depends: R (>= 2.15.2), Rcpp (>= 0.10.2), RcppClassic (>= 0.9.3)
LinkingTo: Rcpp, RcppClassic
