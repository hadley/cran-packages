Description: This software is useful for loading .fasta or .gbk files,
        and for retrieving sequences from GenBank dataset. This package
        allows to detect differences or asymmetries based on nucleotide
        composition by using local linear kernel smoothers. Also, it is
        possible to draw inference about critical points (i. e. maximum
        or minimum points) related with the derivative curves.
        Additionally, bootstrap methods have been used for estimating
        confidence intervals and speed computational techniques
        (binning techniques) have been implemented in seq2R.
