Description: R world provides several packages for working with network
        data.  This package supplements that functionality by providing
        methods for converting network data objects between classes
        defined in other packages. Currently supported classes:
        network, igraph0. This version is compatible with legacy
        version of igraph (prior to 0.6, renamed to igraph0).  Future
        versions of 'intergraph' will be compatible with new igraph API
        (0.6 or later).
