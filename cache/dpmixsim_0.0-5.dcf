Description: The package implements a Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM)
        model for clustering and image segmentation. The DPM model is a
        Bayesian nonparametric methodology that relies on MCMC
        simulations for exploring mixture models with an unknown number
        of components. The code implements conjugate models with normal
        structure (conjugate normal-normal DP mixture model). The
        package's applications are oriented towards the classification
        of magnetic resonance images according to tissue type or region
        of interest.
