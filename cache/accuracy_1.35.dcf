Description: This is a suite of tools designed to test and improve the
        accuracy of statistical computation, including: Summarization
        of the sensitivity of linear and non-linear models (lm, glm,
        mle, nls) to measurement and numerical error; Sensitivity
        analysis of dozens of models as run through Zelig; A
        generalized cholesky method for correcting non-invertable
        Hessians; Tests for the global optimality of non-linear
        regression and maximum likelihood results; Tools for obtaining
        true random numbers using entropy collected from the system
        and/or entropy servers on the internet; A method for converting
        floating point numbers to normalized fractions; Benchmark data
        for checking the accuracy of basic distribution functions.
