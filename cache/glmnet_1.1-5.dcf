Description: Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire
        lasso or elastic-net regularization path for linear regression,
        logistic and multinomial regression models. The algorithm uses
        cyclical coordinate descent in a pathwise fashion, as described
        in the paper on the maintainer's website.
