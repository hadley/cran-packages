Description: This package uses weighted estimating equations to
        estimate regression parameters in the intensity function of an
        inhomogeneous spatial Poisson process, when information on
        risk-factors is available at the individual level for cases,
        but only at a spatially aggregated level for the population at
        risk. Data-driven methods are used to select the weights used
        in the estimating equations. A formal test is available to
        detect non-Poisson behaviour in the underlying point process.
