Description: This package performs prediction for regression-oriented
        problems, aggregating in a nonlinear scheme basic regression
        machines such as the Lasso, random forests, or any other
        provided by the user. If necessary, the computations may be
        parallelized. The method is described in Biau, Fischer, Guedj
        and Malley (2013), "COBRA: A Nonlinear Aggregation Strategy".
