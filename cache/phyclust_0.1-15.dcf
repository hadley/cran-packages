Description: Phylogenetic clustering (phyloclustering) is an evolutionary
        Continuous Time Markov Chain model-based approach to identify
        population structure from molecular data without assuming
        linkage equilibrium. The package phyclust (Chen 2011) provides a
        convenient implementation of phyloclustering for DNA and SNP data,
        capable of clustering individuals into subpopulations and identifying
        molecular sequences representative of those subpopulations. It is
        designed in C for performance, interfaced with R for visualization,
        and incorporates other popular open source programs including
        ms (Hudson 2002), seq-gen (Rambaut and Grassly 1997),
        Hap-Clustering (Tzeng 2005) and PAML baseml (Yang 1997, 2007), for
        simulating data, additional analyses, and searching the best tree.
        See the phyclust website for more information, documentations and
        examples.
