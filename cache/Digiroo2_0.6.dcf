Description: Digiroo2 is an R package developed by researchers at the
        University of Queensland to investigate association patterns
        and social structure in wild animal populations. Proximity
        between individuals is generally considered to be an
        appropriate proxy for associations and pairwise association
        indices are the most widely used technique for analysing animal
        social structure. However, little attention is given to
        identifying how patterns of spatial overlap affect these
        association patterns. For example, do individuals associate
        randomly with others with whom they share home ranges, or do
        some individuals go out of their way to associate with or avoid
        particular individuals? This program builds a null model of
        random associations based on an individual's space use
        determined using home range methodologies. Random points may be
        generated within a specified home range contour or according to
        the Utilization Distribution (UD). Expected associations of
        individuals are extracted based on probability of occurrence
        and the proximity between home range weighted random points.
        Association matrices can be generated from multiple
        permutations for analysis using SOCPROG 2.4 (Whitehead 2009) to
        create 'expected' pairwise half-weight association indices
        (HWIs). These may be compared with the 'observed' HWIs from
        field observations to reveal whether pairs of animals associate
        more (= attraction) or less (= avoidance) than expected by
        chance.
