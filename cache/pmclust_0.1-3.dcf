Description: The pmclust aims to utilize model-based clustering
        (unsupervised) for high dimensional and ultra large data,
        especially in a distributed manner. The package employs Rmpi to
        perform a expectation-gathering-maximization (EGM) algorithm
        for finite mixture Gaussian models. The unstructured dispersion
        matrices are assumed in the Gaussian models. The implementation
        is default in the single program multiple data (SPMD)
        programming model. The code can be executed through Rmpi and
        independent to most MPI applications. See the High Performance
        Statistical Computing (HPSC) website for more information,
        documents and examples.
