Description: Diffusion anisotropy has been used to characterize white
        matter neuronal pathways in the human brain, and infer global
        connectivity in the central nervous system. The package
        implements algorithms to estimate and visualize the orientation
        of neuronal pathways in model-free methods (q-space imaging
        methods). For estimating fibre orientations two methods have
        been implemented. One method implements fibre orientation
        detection through local maxima extraction. A second more robust
        method is based on directional statistical clustering of ODF
        voxel data. Fibre orientations in multiple fibre voxels are
        estimated using a mixture of von Mises-Fisher (vMF)
        distributions. This statistical estimation procedure is used to
        resolve crossing fibre configurations.  Reconstruction of
        orientation distribution function (ODF) profiles may be
        performed using the standard generalized q-sampling imaging
        (GQI) approach, Garyfallidis' GQI (GQI2) approach, or Aganj's
        variant of the Q-ball imaging (CSA-QBI) approach. Procedures
        for the visualization of RGB-maps, line-maps and glyph-maps of
        real diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data-sets are
        included in the package.
