Description: This package contains functions to perform inference via
        simulation from the posterior distributions for Bayesian
        nonparametric and semiparametric models. Although the name of
        the package was motivated by the Dirichlet Process prior, the
        package considers and will consider other priors on functional
        spaces. So far, DPpackage includes models considering Dirichlet
        Processes, Dependent Dirichlet Processes, Dependent Poisson-
        Dirichlet Processes, Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, Polya
        Trees, Linear Dependent Tailfree Processes, Mixtures of
        Triangular distributions, Random Bernstein polynomials priors
        and Dependent Bernstein Polynomials.  The package also includes
        models considering Penalized B-Splines. Currently the package
        includes semiparametric models for marginal and conditional
        density estimation, ROC curve analysis, interval censored data,
        binary regression models, generalized linear mixed models, IRT
        type models, and generalized additive models. The package also
        contains functions to compute Pseudo-Bayes factors for model
        comparison, and to elicitate the precision parameter of the
        Dirichlet Process. To maximize computational efficiency, the
        actual sampling for each model is done in compiled FORTRAN. The
        functions return objects which can be subsequently analyzed
        with functions provided in the coda package.
