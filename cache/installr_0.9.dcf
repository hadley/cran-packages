Description: The 'installr' package aims at making the process of
        updating R on Windows as easy as possible. Also, the package
        contains a (growing) set of functions for allowing users to
        install new software (on Windows OS) using R. By simply running
        the installr() function, the user can easily select (via a GUI
        interface) a software to install. There are also dedicated
        functions for installing each software, such as: updateR(),
        install.RTools(), install.pandoc(), and many more. While for
        Linux users, the installation process of new software may be
        just running a short line of code, for the regular Windows user
        it often includes browsing online, finding the latest version,
        downloading it, running the installer, and deleting the
        installation file. All of these steps are automatically done
        using functions in this package.
