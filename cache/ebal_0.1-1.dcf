Title: Entropy reweighting to create balanced samples
Version: 0.1-1

Description: Package implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing
        procedure that allows users to reweight a dataset such that the
        covariate distributions in the reweighted data satisfy a set of
        user specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create
        balanced samples in observational studies with a binary
        treatment where the control group data can be reweighted to
        match the covariate moments in the treatment group. Entropy
        balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample to known
        characteristics from a target population. This package is
        currently in alpha phase (feedback is appreciated).
