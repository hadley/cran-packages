Description: Generates an allelic richness accumulation curve. This curve shows 
  the expected number of unique alleles in a population when taking a sample of 
  individuals. The function aresCalc takes a binary data matrix as input, 
  showing the presence of alleles per individual, and gives an accumulation 
  curve (mean with 95\% confidence bounds) back. The function aresPlot can be
  used to plot the output from aresCalc.
