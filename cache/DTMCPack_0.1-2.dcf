Description: A series of functions which aid in both simulating and
        determining the properties of finite, discrete-time, discrete
        state markov chains.  Two functions (DTMC, MultDTMC) produce n
        iterations of a Markov Chain(s) based on transition
        probabilities and an initial distribution.  The function FPTime
        determines the first passage time into each state.  The
        function statdistr determines the stationary distribution of a
        Markov Chain.
