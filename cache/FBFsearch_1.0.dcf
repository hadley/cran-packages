Description: We propose an objective Bayesian algorithm for searching
        the space of Gaussian directed acyclic graphical models when
        the variables are assumed to satisfy a given ordering. The
        approach used is based on non-local parameter priors and thus
        it is suitable for learning sparse graphs. The algorithm is
        implemented in C++ using the open-source library Armadillo.
