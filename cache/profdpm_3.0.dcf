Description: This package facilitates profile inference (inference at
        the posterior mode) for a class of product partition models
        (PPM). The Dirichlet process mixture is currently the only
        available member of this class. These methods search for the
        maximum posterior (MAP) estimate for the data partition in a
        PPM.
