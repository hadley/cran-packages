Description: Loop analysis makes qualitative predictions of variable
        change in a system of causally interdependent variabless, where
        "qualitative" means sign only (i.e. increases, decreases, non
        change, and ambiguous). This implementation includes output
        support for graphs in .dot file format for use with
        visualization software such as graphviz (graphviz.org). Loop
        Analyst provides tools for the construction and output of
        community matrices, computation and output of community effect
        matrices, tables of correlations, adjoint, absolute feedback,
        weighted feedback and weighted prediction matrices, change in
        life expectancy matrices, and feedback, path and loop
        enumeration tools.
