Description: This package contains various tools for working with and
        evaluating cross-validated area under the ROC curve (AUC)
        estimators.  The primary functions of the package are ci.cvAUC
        and ci.pooled.cvAUC, which report cross-validated AUC and
        compute confidence intervals for cross-validated AUC estimates
        based on influence curves for i.i.d. and pooled repeated
        measures data, respectively.  One benefit to using influence
        curve based confidence intervals is that they require much less
        computation time than bootstrapping methods.  The utility
        function, cvAUC, which computes cross-validated AUC, is a
        wrapper for functions from the ROCR package.
