Description: The package supplies two efficients nethodologies:
        regularized CCA and sparse PLS to unravel relationships between
        two heterogeneous data sets of size (nxp) and (nxq) where the p
        and q variables are measured on the same samples or individuals
        n. These data may come from high throughput technologies, such
        as omics data, among which transcriptomics, metabolomics or
        proteomics data that require an integrative or joint analysis.
        However, integrOmics can also be applied to any other large
        data sets where p+q>>n. rCCA is a regularized version of CCA to
        deal with the large number of variables. sPLS allows variable
        selection in a one step procedure and two frameworks are
        proposed: regression and canonical analysis. Numerous graphical
        outputs are provided to help interpreting the results.
