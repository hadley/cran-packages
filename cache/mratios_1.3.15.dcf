Description: With this package, it is possible to perform
        (simultaneous) inferences for ratios of linear combinations of
        coefficients in the general linear model. In particular, tests
        and confidence interval estimations for ratios of treatment
        means in the normal one-way layout and confidence interval
        estimations like in (multiple) slope ratio and parallel line
        assays can be carried out. Moreover, it is possible to
        calculate the sample sizes required in comparisons with a
        control based on relative margins. For the simple two-sample
        problem, functions for a t-test for ratio-formatted hypotheses
        and the corresponding Fieller-type confidence interval are
        provided assuming homogeneous or heterogeneous group variances.
