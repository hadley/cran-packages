Description: This package implements a method for normalization,
        testing, and false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing
        data. The description of the method is in Li J, Witten DM,
        Johnstone I, Tibshirani R (2011). Normalization, testing, and
        false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing data. To
        appear, Biostatistics. We estimate the sequencing depths of
        experiments using a new method based on Poisson goodness-of-fit
        statistic, calculate a score statistic on the basis of a
        Poisson log-linear model, and then estimate the false discovery
        rate using a modified version of permutation plug-in method. A
        more detailed instruction as well as sample data is available
        at http://www.stanford.edu/~junli07/research.html.
