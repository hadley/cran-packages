Description: The NOIA model, as described extensively in Alvarez-Castro & Carlborg (2007), is a framework facilitating the estimation of genetic effects and genotype-to-phenotype maps. This package provides the basic tools to perform linear and multilinear regressions from real populations (provided the phenotype and the genotype of every individuals), estimating the genetic effects from different reference points, the genotypic values, and the decomposition of genetic variances in a multi-locus, 2 alleles system. This package is presented in Le Rouzic & Alvarez-Castro (2008).
