Description: This packages provides a set of tools for post processing
        the outcomes of species distribution modeling exercises. It
        includes novel methods for comparing models and tracking
        changes in distributions through time. It further includes
        methods for visualizing outcomes, selecting thresholds,
        calculating measures of accuracy and landscape fragmentation
        statistics, etc.. This package was made possible in part by
        financial support from the Australian Research Council & ARC
        Research Network for Earth System Science.
