Description: Compute a matrix comparison of lists (from 2 to infinite)
        and plot the results in a Venn diagram if (N<=4) with
        regulation details. It allows to produce a complete annotated
        file, merging the annotations of the compared lists. It is also
        possible to compute an overlaps table to show the overlaps
        proportions of all the couples of lists and draw proportional
        Venn diagrams.
