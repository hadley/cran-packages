Description: This package facilitates easy analysis of factorial
        experiments, including purely within-Ss designs (a.k.a.
        "repeated measures"), purely between-Ss designs, and mixed
        within-and-between-Ss designs. The functions in this package
        aim to provide simple, intuitive and consistent specification
        of data analysis and visualization. Visualization functions
        also include design visualization for pre-analysis data
        auditing, and correlation matrix visualization. Finally, this
        package includes functions for non-parametric analysis,
        including permutation tests and bootstrap resampling. The
        bootstrap function obtains predictions either by cell means or
        by more advanced/powerful mixed effects models, yielding
        predictions and confidence intervals that may be easily
        visualized at any level of the experiment's design.
