Description: This package implements a bayesian sparse factor model for
        the joint analysis of paired datasets, one is the gene
        expression dataset and the other is the drug sensitivity
        profiles, measured across the same panel of samples, e.g., cell
        lines. Prior knowledge about gene-pathway associations can be
        easily incorporated in the model to aid the inference of
        drug-pathway associations.
