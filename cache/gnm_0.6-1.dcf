Package: gnm
Title: Generalized Nonlinear Models
Version: 0.6-1
Date: 2005-06-24
Author: Heather Turner and David Firth
Description: Functions to specify and fit generalized nonlinear models, including models with multiplicative interaction terms such as the UNIDIFF model from sociology and the AMMI model from crop science.  This is a major re-working of an earlier Xlisp-Stat package, "Llama".  Over-parameterized representations of models are used throughout; functions are provided for inference on estimable parameter combinations, as well as standard methods for diagnostics etc.
