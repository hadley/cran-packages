Description: Functions to assist in the processing and exploration of
        data from monitoring programs for aquatic ecosystems. The name
        "wq" stands for "water quality" and reflects a focus on time
        series data for physical and chemical properties of water, as
        well as the plankton. The package is intended for programs that
        sample approximately monthly at discrete stations, a feature of
        many legacy data sets. Although our emphasis is on aquatic
        ecosystems, most of the functions should be useful for analysis
        of similar-frequency time series regardless of the subject
        matter.
