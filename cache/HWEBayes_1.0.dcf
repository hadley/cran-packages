Description: Estimation and testing of HWE using Bayesian methods.
        Three models are currently considered: HWE, a model
        parameterized in terms of the allele frequencies and a single
        inbreeding coeffcient \eqn{f}, and the saturated model. Testing
        is based on Bayes factors.
