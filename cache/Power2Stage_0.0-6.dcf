Description: Contains functions to calculate power and sample size distribution
             of 2-stage BE studies according to Potvin et.al. / Montague et. al. 
             modified to include a futility Nmax 
             and modified to do the sample size estimation step with PE and mse  
             of stage 1 as well as the power calculation steps according to
             Karalis & Macheras.
             The third function calculates power and sample size distribution
             of 2-stage BE studies with a futility criterion for the point
             estimator of T/R from stage 1.
