Description: This is a bare-bones implementation of sampling algorithms
        for a variety of Bayesian stick-breaking (marginally DP)
        mixture models, including particle learning and Gibbs sampling
        for static DP mixtures, particle learning for dynamic BAR
        stick-breaking, and DP mixture regression. The software is
        designed to be easy to customize to suit different situations
        and for experimentation with stick-breaking models.  Since
        particles are repeatedly copied, it is not an especially
        efficient implementation.
