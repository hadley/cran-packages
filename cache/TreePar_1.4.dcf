Description: For a given phylogeny on present day data which is
        calibrated to calendar-time, a method for estimating maximum
        likelihood speciation and extinction processes is provided. The
        method allows for non-constant rates. Rates may change (i) as a
        function of time (rate shifts at specified times or mass
        extinction events) or (ii) as a function of the number of
        species (density-dependence). Note that the method takes into
        account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the
        "pull of the present" effect.
