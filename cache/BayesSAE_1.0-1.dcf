Description: This package provides a variety of functions to deal with several specific small area area-
  level models in Bayesian context. Models provided range from the basic Fay-Herriot model to 
  its improvement such as You-Chapman models, unmatched models, spatial models and so on. 
  Different types of priors for specific parameters could be chosen to obtain MCMC posterior 
  draws. The main sampling function is written in C with GSL lab so as to facilitate the 
  computation. Model internal checking and model comparison criteria are also involved.
