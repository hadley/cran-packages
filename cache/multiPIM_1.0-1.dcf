Description: Performs variable importance analysis for possibly many
        exposures of interest and possibly many outcomes of interest.
        This is done by fitting Population Intervention Models, using
        either Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighted (IPCW) or
        Double-Robust IPCW (DR-IPCW) estimators. Inference can be
        obtained from the influence curve or by bootstrapping.
