Description: A graphical user interface for viewing and interacting with R plots.
  It tries to work out the structure of a plot, in order to interact with it.
  The built-in features include: navigating the data space, identifying data points,
  editing and annotating the plot, and saving to a file. New tools can be defined.
  Note: the interaction features do not work with multiple-plot layouts. 
  This package is based on RGtk2, and so requires the GTK+ libraries.
