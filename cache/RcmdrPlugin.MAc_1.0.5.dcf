Description: This is an R-Commander plug-in for the MAc package
        (Meta-Analysis with Correlations). This package enables the
        user to conduct a meta-analysis in a menu-driven, graphical
        user interface environment (e.g., SPSS), while having the full
        statistical capabilities of R and the MAc package. The MAc
        package itself contains a variety of useful functions for
        conducting a research synthesis with correlational data. One of
        the unique features of the MAc package is in its integration of
        user-friendly functions to complete all statistical steps
        involved in a meta-analysis with correlations. It uses
        recommended procedures as described in The Handbook of Research
        Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, & Valentine,
        2009).
