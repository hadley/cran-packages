Description: Method for protein quantification based on identified and
    quantified peptides. protiq can be used for absolute and relative protein
    quantification. Input peptide abundance scores can come from various
    sources, including SRM transition areas and intensities or spectral counts
    derived from shotgun experiments. The package is still being extended to
    also include the model for protein identification, MIPGEM, presented in
    Gerster, S., Qeli, E., Ahrens, C.H. and Buehlmann, P. (2010). Protein and
    gene model inference based on statistical modeling in k-partite graphs.
