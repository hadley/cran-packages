Description: Functions to convert Rd to roxygen
    documentation. It can parse an Rd file to a list,
    create the roxygen documentation and update the
    original R script (e.g. the one containing the
    definition of the function) accordingly. This package
    also provides utilities which can help developers build
    packages using roxygen more easily. The formatR package
    can be used to reformat the R code in the examples
    sections so that the code will be more readable.
