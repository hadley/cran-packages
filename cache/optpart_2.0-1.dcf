Description: The package contains a set of algorithms for creating
        partitions and coverings of objects largely based on operations
        on similarity relations (or matrices). There are several
        iterative re-assigmnent algorithms optimizing different
        goodness-of-clustering criteria.  In addition, there are
        covering algorithms "clique" which derives maximal cliques, and
        "maxpact" which creates a covering of maximally compact sets.
        Graphical analyses and conversion routines are also included.
