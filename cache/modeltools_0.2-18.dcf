Description: A collection of tools to deal with statistical models. The
        functionality is experimental and the user interface is likely
        to change in the future. The documentation is rather terse, but
        packages `coin' and `party' have some working examples.
        However, if you find the implemented ideas interesting we would
        be very interested in a discussion of this proposal.
        Contributions are more than welcome!
