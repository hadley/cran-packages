Description: This package takes radiocarbon (or similar) dating
        information to produce chronology reconstructions for age-depth
        data. The package allows for: radiocarbon and non-radiocarbon
        depths, thickness errors, outlying dates, multiple calibration
        curves, and event prediction. It also produces some pretty
        pictures, and writes all output to files to allow for further
        analysis (eg palaeoclimate reconstruction). There is a menu
        system for users, as well as a command line interface for
        advanced and/or batch processing. Version 3.1 contains an
        update to produce better plots of proxy data via the function
        Bchronproxyplot. Version 3.2 includes new functions for
        estimating rates of relative sea level change, and a quick
        radiocarbon calibration function for individual dates.
