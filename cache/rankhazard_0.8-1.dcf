Description: Rank-hazard plots (Karvanen and Harrell, Statistics in
        Medicine 2009) visualize the relative importance of covariates
        in a proportional hazards model. The key idea is to rank the
        covariate values and plot the relative hazard as a function of
        ranks scaled to interval [0,1]. The relative hazard is plotted
        with respect to the reference hazard, which can be e.g. the
        hazard related to the median of the covariate. Transformation
        to scaled ranks allows plotting of covariates measured in
        different units in the same graph, which helps in the
        interpretation of the epidemiological relevance of the
        covariates. Rank-hazard plots show the difference of hazards
        between the extremes of the covariate values present in the
        data and can be used as a tool to check if the proportional
        hazards assumption leads to reasonable estimates for
        individuals with extreme covariate values. Alternative
        covariate definitions or different transformations applied to
        covariates can be also compared using rank-hazard plots.
