Description: The main functions are fixed effect back-fitting functions
        (on F or t values and log-likelihood ratio testing) and a
        random effect forward-fitting function (log-likelihood ratio
        testing). Other functions include a function to compute ANOVAs
        with upper-bound p-values (anti-conservative), a function to
        graph model criticism plots, and another to trim data on model
        residuals.
