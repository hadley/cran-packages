Author: Greg Ridgeway <gregr@rand.org> with contributions from others
Maintainer: Greg Ridgeway <gregr@rand.org>
Depends: R (>= 2.9.0), survival, lattice, splines
Suggests: RUnit
Description: This package implements extensions to Freund and
        Schapire's AdaBoost algorithm and Friedman's gradient boosting
        machine. Includes regression methods for least squares,
        absolute loss, t-distribution loss, quantile regression,
        logistic, multinomial logistic, Poisson, Cox proportional
        hazards partial likelihood, AdaBoost exponential loss,
        Huberized hinge loss, and Learning to Rank measures
        (LambdaMart).
