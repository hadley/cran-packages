Description: 
    CRQA is a package to perform cross-recurrence quantification
    analysis between two time-series, of either categorical or
    continuous values. It provides different methods
    for profiling cross-recurrence, i.e., only looking
    at the diagonal recurrent points, as well as more
    in-depth measures of the whole cross-recurrence plot,
    e.g., percentage recurrence.
