Title: Solving and Optimizing Large-Scale Nonlinear Systems
Description: Barzilai-Borwein spectral methods for solving nonlinear
        system of equations, and for optimizing nonlinear objective
        functions subject to simple constraints. A tutorial style
        introduction to this package is available in a vignette on the
        CRAN download page or, when the package is loaded in an R
        session, with vignette("BB").
