Description: The migest package contains a collection of R functions
        that are useful to estimate migration when there is missing
        data. Included is the ffs routine to estimate migration flows
        from stock data, as well as various other functions to
        indirectly estimate flows where marginal totals are known.
        Functions are illustrated with dummy data.
