Title: Statistical Analysis of Haplotypes with Traits and 
       Covariates when Linkage Phase is Ambiguous.
Author: Jason P. Sinnwell and Daniel J. Schaid
Maintainer: Jason P. Sinnwell <sinnwell@mayo.edu>
Description: Haplo Stats is a suite of S-PLUS/R routines for the
	     analysis of indirectly measured haplotypes. The statistical methods
	     assume that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are
	     ambiguous (due to unknown linkage phase of the genetic markers).  
	     The genetic markers are assumed to be codominant (i.e., one-to-one 
	     correspondence between their genotypes and their phenotypes), and so 
	     we refer to the measurements of genetic markers as genotypes. The main
	     functions in Haplo Stats are:  haplo.em, haplo.glm and haplo.score
