Description: The "Manual on Low-flow Estimation and Prediction",
        published by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), gives
        an idea how to analyse stream flow data focusing on low-flow
        issues. This packages gives functions to compute the described
        statistics and produce plots similar to the one in the manual.
