Description: It allows to estimate a dose-response relation from single and multiple summarized data. The trend estimation takes into account the correlation
		among log relative risks and use it to efficiently estimate the dose-response relation for each study included in the analysis. The results are then combined according to principles
		of multivariate random effects meta-analysis to obtain a pooled functional relation.
