Title: Hierarchical Bayesian Small Area Estimation
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Description: Functions to compute small area estimates based on a basic
        area or unit-level model. The model is fit using restricted
        maximum likelihood, or in a hierarchical Bayesian way. In the
        latter case numerical integration is used to average over the
        posterior density for the between-area variance.  The output
        includes the model fit, small area estimates and corresponding
        MSEs, as well as some model selection measures. Additional
        functions provide means to compute aggregate estimates and
        MSEs, to minimally adjust the small area estimates to
        benchmarks at a higher aggregation level, and to graphically
        compare different sets of small area estimates.
