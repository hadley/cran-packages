Title: Freedom From Disease
Depends: R (>= 2.10), methods, graphics, tcltk, tkrplot, R2HTML
Suggests: methods
SystemRequirements: BWidget
Description: Functions, S4 classes/methods and a graphical user
        interface (GUI) to design surveys to substantiate freedom from
        disease using a modified hypergeometric function (see Cameron
        and Baldock, 1997). Herd sensitivities are computed according
        to sampling strategies "individual sampling" or "limited
        sampling" (see M. Ziller, T. Selhorst, J. Teuffert, M. Kramer
        and H. Schlueter, 2002). Methods to compute the a-posteriori
        alpha-error are implemented. Risk-based targeted sampling is
        supported.
