Author: Gabriel E Leventhal, partly adapted from MATLAB code by Awad H.
        Al-Mohy and using the routines DLNAC1 and DLARPC by Sheung Hun
        Cheng, and DLAPST from ScaLAPACK.

Description: Calculates the density dependent likelihood of a
        phylogenetic tree. It takes branching and sampling times as an
        argument and integrates the likelihood function over the whole
        tree.
