Description: Basic wavelet routines for time series (1D), image (2D)
        and array (3D) analysis.  The code provided here is based on
        wavelet methodology developed in Percival and Walden (2000);
        Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); the dual-tree complex
        wavelet transform (DTCWT) from Kingsbury (1999, 2001) as
        implemented by Selesnick; and Hilbert wavelet pairs (Selesnick
        2001, 2002).  All figures in chapters 4-7 of GSW (2001) are
        reproducible using this package and R code available at the
        book website(s) below.
