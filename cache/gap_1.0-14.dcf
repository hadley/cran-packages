Description: It is designed as an integrated package for genetic data
        analysis of both population and family data. Currently, it
        contains functions for sample size calculations of both
        population-based and family-based designs, classic twin models, 
        probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation, 
        some statistics in linkage analysis, and association analysis 
        involving one or more genetic markers including haplotype 
        analysis with or without environmental covariates.
