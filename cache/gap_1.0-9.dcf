Description: This is an integrated package for genetic data analysis
        of both population and family data. Currently it contains
        functions for sample size calculations of both population-based
        and family-based designs, classic twin ACE/ADE/AE/CE models, 
        probability of familial disease aggregation, kinship calculation, 
        some statistics in linkage analysis, and association analysis 
        involving one or more genetic markers including haplotype 
        analysis with or without environmental covariates.

        under GPL. Specific requirement may be possible for programs
        written by other authors.
