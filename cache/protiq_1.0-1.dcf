Description: Method for protein quantification based on identified and
        quantified peptides. protiq can be used for absolute and
        relative protein quantification. Input peptide abundance scores
        can come from various sources, including SRM transition areas
        and intentisites or spectral counts derived from shotgun
        experiments. The package is still being extended to also
        include the model for protein identification, MIPGEM, presented
        in Gerster, S., Qeli, E., Ahrens, C.H. and Buehlmann, P.
        (2010). Protein and gene model inference based on statistical
        modeling in k-partite graphs. Proceedings of the National
        Academy of Sciences 107(27):12101-12106.
