Description: The Mean Score method for missing and auxiliary covariate data 
	is described in the paper by Reilly & Pepe in Biometrika 1995. 
	This likelihood-based method allows an analysis using all available
	cases and hence will give more efficient estimates. 
	The method is applicable to cohort or case-control designs.
