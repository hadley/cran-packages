Version: 2013.4.1
Date: 2013-04-25
Author: Tomas Radivoyevitch
Description: This package contains codes that setup SEER (Surveillance,
        Epidemiology and End Results) data use with R.  It includes
        SEER and Japanese A-Bomb survivor data analysis examples.  By
        using it, the portability of SEER R scripts should improve.
        This package works only with the latest SEER release of April
        24, 2013.
