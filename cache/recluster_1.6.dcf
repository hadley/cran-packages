Description: A high frequency of ties and zero values produces
        hierarchical cluster dendrograms whose topology and bootstrap
        supports are affected by the order of rows in the original
        matrix. The recluster package evaluates the magnitude of this
        bias and computes consensus trees after re-sampling the
        original row order also applying this algorithm to a multiscale
        bootstrap procedure.
