Description: Bayesian network structure learning (via constraint-based,
  score-based and hybrid algorithms), parameter learning (via ML and
  Bayesian estimators) and inference.
  This package implements the Grow-Shrink (GS) algorithm, the Incremental
  Association (IAMB) algorithm, the Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB)
  algorithm, the Fast-IAMB (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the Max-Min Parents
  and Children (MMPC) algorithm, the ARACNE and Chow-Liu algorithms, the
  Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search algorithm, the Tabu Search (TABU)
  algorithm, the Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) algorithm and the two-stage
  Restricted Maximization (RSMAX2) algorithm for both discrete and Gaussian
  networks, along with many score functions and conditional
  independence tests.
  Some utility functions (model comparison and manipulation, random
  data generation, arc orientation testing, simple and advanced plots)
  are included, as well as support for parameter estimation and
  inference, conditional probability queries and cross-validation.
