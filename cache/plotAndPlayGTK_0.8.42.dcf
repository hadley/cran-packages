Description: A graphical user interface for R plots. Wrap it around your plot calls,
  like playwith(plot(mydata)). A window pops up with a Cairo plot device and 
  a toolbar with buttons to interact with the plot. The default buttons allow you 
  to add persistent labels to data points, zoom in and out and around, save the 
  plot to a file, and so on. Furthermore, you can edit the plot call on the fly.
  There are buttons to work with multiple panels and pages of a Lattice plot. 
  For multi-variate scatterplots 
  ('splom' only) there is a "brush" function, and for 3D plots ('wireframe' / 
  'cloud' only) there is a simple zoom and rotate. New buttons can also be defined; 
  actually any GTK+ widget can be added to the toolbar. 
  Note: code to generate the plot will need to be wrapped up into a single call 
  with some standard arguments, and the interaction features do not work well 
  with multiple-plot layouts. As yet it does not work with grid-based plots other 
  than Lattice (such as ggplot2), but button handlers could be written. This 
  package is based on RGtk2, and so requires the GTK+ libraries.
  Also included in this package are several utilities for RGtk2 applications.
