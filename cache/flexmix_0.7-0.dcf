Title: Flexible Mixture Modeling
Description: FlexMix implements a general framework for finite
  mixtures of regression models using the EM algorithm. 
  FlexMix provides the E-step and all data handling, while the M-step can be
  supplied by the user to easily define new models. Existing drivers
  implement mixtures of standard linear models, generalized linear
  models and model-based clustering.
