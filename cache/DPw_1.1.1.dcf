Description: The purpose of the functions implemented in this package
        is to find a subset containing the weakest species with some
        acceptable certainty. Suppose we have sampled some quality
        measures T_{k,j} (>=0) from K species (k=1,...,K, j=1,...,m_k=
        sample size of kth species), and wish to find the species with
        the smallest alpha quantile (say, 5th percentile) of T (namely
        the weakest species). Due to the small sample size (m_k) or
        large number of species to be considered (K), we might not be
        able to select a single species as a weakest one with
        acceptably large certainty. Instead of selecting a single
        species with a low certainty, we propose to select a subset of
        species which contains the weakest species with predetermined
        certainty.
