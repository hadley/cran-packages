        download and format the GHCN V3 data and process it into
        temperature series and temperature anomaly series. The data is
        reformated so that integration with objects in the
        \code{raster} system is straightforward. In addition, there are
        core functions required to download and create land masks and
        functions to download and import Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
        data.
