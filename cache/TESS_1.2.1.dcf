Description: TESS is a package for simulation of reconstructed
        phylogenetic trees under global, time-dependent birth-death
        processes. Speciation and extinction rates can be any function
        of time and mass-extinction events at specific times can be
        provided. Trees can be simulated either conditioned on the
        number of species, the time of the process, or both.
        Additionally, the likelihood equations are implemented for
        convenience and can be used for Maximum Likelihood (ML)
        estimation and Bayesian inference.
