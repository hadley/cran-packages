Description: Given a set of phylogenetic trees on a group of taxa (for
        example trees based on individual gene sequences), we present a
        method for identifying a subset of trees which are discordant
        with the other trees in the set. These discordant trees may
        arise from either biologically interesting phenomena
        (horizontal gene transfers, for example) or more mundane
        sequencing or annotation errors.
