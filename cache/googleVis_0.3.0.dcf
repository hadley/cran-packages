Description: The googleVis package provides an interface between R and
        the Google Chart Tools, formerly know as Google Visualisation
        API. It allows users to create web pages with interactive
        charts based on R data frames, using the Google Chart Tools and
        to display them either via the local R HTTP help server or
        within their own sites, without uploading the data to Google. A
        modern browser with Internet connection is required and for
        some charts Flash. Please visit the project web site for more
        information and examples.
Depends: R (>= 2.11.0), methods, RJSONIO, utils
