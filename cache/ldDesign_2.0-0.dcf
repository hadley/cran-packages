Description: R package for design of experiments for design of genome-wide
  association studies.  Version 2 incorporating quantitative traits and 
  case-control studies. The Bayes factor should be chosen large enough to 
  give respectable posterior odds. This requires Bayes factors of the order 
  of 10^6 in genome-wide association studies where prior odds are low. Sample sizes needed to get this strength of evidence are substantially higher than those from traditional power calculations. The corresponding threshold for p-values is substantially lower than commonly used.
  For quantitative traits
  ldDesign uses an existing deterministic power calculation for detection 
  of linkage disequilibrium between a bi-allelic QTL and a bi-allelic marker,
  together with the Spiegelhalter and Smith Bayes factor to generate
  designs with power to detect effects with a given Bayes factor. For case-
  control studies an asymptotic approximate Bayes factor is used to derive
  an analytical power calculation in dominant, recessive, additive
  and general genetic models.
