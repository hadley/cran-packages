Description: The DoseFinding package provides functions for the design and analysis
	     of dose-finding experiments (with focus on pharmaceutical Phase
	     II clinical trials). It provides functions for: multiple contrast
	     tests, fitting non-linear dose-response models (using Bayesian and
	     non-Bayesian estimation), calculating optimal designs and an
	     implementation of the MCPMod methodology.
