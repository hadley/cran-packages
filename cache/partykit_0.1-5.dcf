Description: A toolkit with infrastructure for representing,
        summarizing, and visualizing tree-structured regression and
        classification models. This unified infrastructure can be used
        for reading/coercing tree models from different sources (rpart,
        RWeka, PMML) yielding objects that share functionality for
        print/plot/predict methods. (It will also be the basis for a
        re-implementation of the party package. Currently, only a
        re-implementation of ctree() is contained in the package.)
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), graphics, stats, grid
Imports: survival
Suggests: XML, pmml, mlbench, RWeka, rJava, rpart, mvtnorm, Formula,
        ipred
