Description: The gRbase package provides certain general constructs
        which are used by other graphical modelling packages. This
        includes 1) the concept of gmData (graphical meta data), 2)
        several graph algorithms 3) facilities for table operations, 4)
        functions for testing for conditional independence. gRbase also
        illustrates how hierarchical log-linear models (hllm) may be
        implemented.
