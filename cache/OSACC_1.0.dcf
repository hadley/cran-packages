Description: Genetic heterogeneity can reduce the power for complex
        disease gene mapping since only a fraction of the cases in the
        collected dataset may carry a specific disease susceptibility
        allele. The Ordered Subset Analysis for Case-Control data
        (OSACC) program was designed to evaluate evidence for
        association in the presence of genetic heterogeneity. For a
        more detailed description of the method and results of an
        extensive simulation study based on different models of genetic
        heterogeneity. Please see Qin et. al.(2010), Ordered Subset
        Analysis for Case-Control Studies, Genetic Epidemiology 34(5),
        407-417.
