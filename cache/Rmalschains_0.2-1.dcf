Title: Continuous Optimization using Memetic Algorithms with Local
        Search Chains (MA-LS-Chains) in R

Author: Christoph Bergmeir, Daniel Molina, José M. Benítez
Description: This package implements an algorithm family for continuous
        optimization called memetic algorithms with local search chains
        (MA-LS-Chains). Memetic algorithms are hybridizations of
        genetic algorithms with local search methods. They are
        especially suited for continuous optimization.
