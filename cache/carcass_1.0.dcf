Description: The number of bird or bat fatalities from collisions with
        buildings, towers or wind energy turbines can be estimated
        based on carcass searches and experimentally assessed carcass
        persistence times and searcher efficiency. This package
        provides diverse functions for estimating the probability that
        a bird or bat that died is found by a searcher. It further
        provides a function to obtain a posterior distribution of the
        number of fatalities based on the number of carcasses found and
        the estimated detection probability.
