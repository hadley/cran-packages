Description:
	This package contains two main interfaces for fitting
	and diagnosing bent-cable regressions for autoregressive
	time-series data or independent data (time series or
	otherwise). The interfaces are 'bentcable.ar()' and 
	'bentcable.dev.plot()'. Some components in the package can 
	also be used as stand-alone functions. The bent cable 
	(linear-quadratic-linear) generalizes the broken stick 
	(linear-linear), which is also handled by this package.
