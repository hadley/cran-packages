Description: This package contains implementations of various classes
        of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on copula
        theory: Copula EDAs and Vine EDAs. In this package, EDAs are
        implemented using S4 classes with generic functions for its
        main parts: seeding, selection, learning, sampling,
        replacement, local optimization, termination, and reporting.
        The package also includes the implementation of a group of
        well-known optimization test problems and utility functions to
        study the behavior of EDAs.
