Description: MLPAstats is a software designed to test copy number
        differences between case and control samples, identified with
        multiplex-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) data. The
        package incorporates several methods for data normalization and
        copy number alterations such as REX-regression, threshold
        approach and mixed-models.
