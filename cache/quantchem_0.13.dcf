Description: Statistical evaluation of calibration curves by different
        regression techniques: ordinary, weighted, robust (up to 4th
        order polynomial).  Log-log and Box-Cox transform, estimation
        of optimal power and weighting scheme. Tests for
        heteroscedascity and normality of residuals. Different kinds of
        plots commonly used in illustrating calibrations. Easy "inverse
        prediction" of concentration by given responses and statistical
        evaluation of results (comparison of precision and accuracy by
        common tests).
