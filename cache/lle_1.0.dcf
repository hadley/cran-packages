Description: LLE is a non-linear algorithm for mapping high-dimensional
        data into a lower dimensional (intrinsic) space. This package
        provides the main functions to performs the LLE alogrithm
        including some enhancements like subset selection, calculation
        of the intrinsic dimension etc.
