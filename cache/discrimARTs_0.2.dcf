Description: 'discrimARTs' discriminates with explicit confidence the alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in dimorphic systems with bimodal traits by computing the maximum likelihood estimate of a mixture of distributions of a measured ARTs trait. Supported distributions include a mixture of 2 normal distributions and a mixture of 2 facing gamma distributions.
