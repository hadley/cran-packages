Description: Rmpfr provides S4 classes and methods for arithmetic
        including transcendental ("special") functions for arbitrary
        precision floating point numbers. To this end, it interfaces to
        the LGPL'ed MPFR (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable)
        Library which itself is based on the GMP (GNU Multiple
        Precision) Library.
