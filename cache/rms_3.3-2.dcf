Description: Regression modeling, testing, estimation, validation,
	graphics, prediction, and typesetting by storing enhanced model design
	attributes in the fit.  rms is a collection of 229 functions that
	assist with and streamline modeling.  It also contains functions for
	binary and ordinal logistic regression models and the Buckley-James
	multiple regression model for right-censored responses, and implements
	penalized maximum likelihood estimation for logistic and ordinary
	linear models.  rms works with almost any regression model, but it
	was especially written to work with binary or ordinal logistic
	regression, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models,
	ordinary linear models,	the Buckley-James model, generalized least
	squares for serially or spatially correlated observations, generalized
	linear models, and quantile regression.
