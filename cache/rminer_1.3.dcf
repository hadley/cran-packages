Title: Simpler use of data mining methods (e.g. NN and SVM) in
        classification and regression.

Description: This package facilitates the use of data mining algorithms
        in classification and regression tasks by presenting a short
        and coherent set of functions. While several DM algorithms can
        be used, it is particularly suited for Neural Networks (NN) and
        Support Vector Machines (SVM). Version 1.3 - new classification
        and regression metrics (improved mmetric function); version 1.2
        - new input importance methods (improved Importance function);
        version 1.1 - minor error corrections; version 1.0 - first
        version.
