Description: Link communities reveal the nested and overlapping
        structure in networks, and uncover the key nodes that form
        connections to multiple communities. linkcomm provides a set of
        tools for generating, visualizing, and analysing link
        communities in networks of arbitrary size and type. The
        linkcomm package also includes tools for generating,
        visualizing, and analysing Overlapping Cluster Generator (OCG)
