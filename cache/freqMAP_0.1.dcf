Description: A frequency moving average plot (MAP) is estimated from a
        multinomial data and a continuous covariate. The frequency MAP
        is a moving average estimate of category frequencies, where
        frequency means and posterior bounds are estimated. Comparisons
        of two frequency MAPs as well as odds ratios can be plotted.
