Title: Utility functions for working with Random Number Generators
Description: This package contains a set of functions for working with
        Random Number Generators (RNGs). In particular, it defines a
        generic S4 framework for getting/setting the current RNG, or
        RNG data that are embedded into objects for reproducibility.
        Notably, convenient default methods greatly facilitate the way
        current RNG settings can be changed.
