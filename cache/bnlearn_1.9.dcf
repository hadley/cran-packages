Description: Bayesian network structure learning via constraint-based
        (also known as 'conditional independence'), score-based and
        hybrid algorithms. This package implements the Grow-Shrink (GS)
        algorithm, the Incremental Association (IAMB) algorithm, the
        Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB) algorithm, the Fast-IAMB
        (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the Max-Min Parents and Children (MMPC)
        algorithm, the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search algorithm, the
        Tabu Search (TABU) algorithm, the Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC)
        algorithm and the two-stage Restricted Maximization (RSMAX2)
        algorithm for both discrete and Gaussian networks, along with
        many score functions and conditional independence tests. Some
        utility functions (model comparison and manipulation, random
        data generation, arc orientation testing, simple and advanced
        plots) are included, as well as basic parametric and bootstrap
        inference functions.
