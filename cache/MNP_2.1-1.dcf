Description: MNP is a publicly available R package that fits the Bayesian
  multinomial probit model via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The
  multinomial probit model is often used to analyze the discrete
  choices made by individuals recorded in survey data. Examples where
  the multinomial probit model may be useful include the analysis of
  product choice by consumers in market research and the analysis of
  candidate or party choice by voters in electoral studies.  The MNP
  software can also fit the model with different choice sets for each
  individual, and complete or partial individual choice orderings of
  the available alternatives from the choice set. The estimation
  is based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm that
  is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2005).
