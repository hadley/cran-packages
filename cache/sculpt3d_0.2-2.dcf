Description: sculpt3d is a GTK+ toolbar that allows for more
        interactive control of a dataset inside the RGL plot window.
        Controls for simple brushing, highlighting, labeling, and
        mouseMode changes are provided by point-and-click rather than
        through the R terminal interface.
