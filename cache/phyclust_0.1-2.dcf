Description: Phylogenetic clustering (Phyloclustering) is a model-based
        approach with the evolution theories and the Continuous Time
        Markov Chain theory to identify population structures at the
        molecular level without assuming linkage equilibrium. A finite
        mixture model optimized by EM algorithms is implemented in C
        with varied evolution models, identifiers, initializations and
        optimizations. It also includes ms and seq-gen for generate
        coalescent trees and sequences, and Hap-Clustering for SNP
        sequences. See the phyclust website for more information,
        documentations and examples.
