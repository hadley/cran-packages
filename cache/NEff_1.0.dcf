Description: NEff is an individual based model. This package uses demographic parameter of a population to calculate annual effective sizes and effective population sizes (per generation). It assumes that no migration and mutation is occurring. A defined number of alleles and loci will be used to simulate the genotypes of the individuals. These results will help managers to define existing populations as viable or not.
