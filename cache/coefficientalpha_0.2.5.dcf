Description: Cronbach's alpha is one of the most widely used
        reliability or internal consistency measures in social,
        behavioral and education sciences. Alpha is reported in nearly
        every study that involves measuring a construct through
        multiple test items. The package coefficientalpha calculates
        Cronbach's coefficient alpha with missing data and non-normal
        data. Robust standard error and confidence interval are also
        provided.
