Title: Ridge regression and other kernels for genomic selection
Version: 2.8
Author: Jeffrey Endelman 
Maintainer: Jeffrey Endelman <j.endelman@gmail.com>
Description: One application is to estimate marker effects by ridge regression; alternatively, BLUPs can be calculated based on kinship.  The genetic covariance between lines can be modeled using a marker-based, additive relationship matrix, or via Gaussian and exponential kernels.
