Description: The equate package contains functions for non-IRT equating
        under both random groups and nonequivalent groups with anchor
        test designs. Mean, linear, equipercentile and circle-arc
        equating are supported, as are methods for univariate and
        bivariate presmoothing of score distributions. Specific
        equating methods currently supported include synthetic, nominal
        weights, Tucker, Levine observed score, Levine true score,
        Braun/Holland, frequency estimation, and chained equating.
