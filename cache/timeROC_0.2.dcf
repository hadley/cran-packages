Description: Estimation of time-dependent ROC curve and area under time
        dependent ROC curve (AUC) in the presence of censored data,
        with or without competing risks. Confidence intervals of AUCs
        and tests for comparing AUCs of two rival markers measured on
        the same subjects can be computed, using the iid-representation
        of the AUC estimator. Plot functions for time-dependent ROC
        curves and AUC curves are provided. Time-dependent Positive
        Predictive Values (PPV) and Negative Predictive Values (NPV)
        can also be computed.
