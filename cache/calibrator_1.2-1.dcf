Description: Performs Bayesian calibration of computer models as per
        Kennedy and O'Hagan 2001.  The package includes routines to
        find the hyperparameters and parameters; see the help page for
        stage1() for a worked example using the toy dataset.  A
        tutorial is provided in the calex.Rnw vignette; and a suite of
        especially simple one dimensional examples appears in
        inst/doc/one.dim/.
