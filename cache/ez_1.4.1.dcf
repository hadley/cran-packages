Description: This package facilitates easy analysis of factorial
        experiments, including purely within-Ss designs (a.k.a.
        "repeated measures"), purely between-Ss designs, and mixed
        within-and-between-Ss designs. The functions in this package
        provide easy access to descriptive statistics, ANOVA,
        permutation tests, and visualization of results.
