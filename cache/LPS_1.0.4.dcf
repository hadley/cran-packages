Description: This package provides functions implementing the Linear Predictor Score approach, as initiated by Radmacher et al. (J Comput Biol 2001) and enhanced by Wright et al. (PNAS 2003). Given a set of continuous variables (typically gene expression values), it builds a simple score able to retrieve previously defined classes.
