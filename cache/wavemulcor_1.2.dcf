Description: Wavelet routines that calculate single sets of wavelet
        multiple correlations and cross-correlations out of n variables
        (either 1D time series, 2D images or 3D arrays). They can later
        be plotted in single graphs, as an alternative to trying to
        make sense out of several sets of wavelet correlations or
        wavelet cross-correlations. The code is based on the
        calculation, at each wavelet scale, of the square root of the
        coefficient of determination in a linear combination of
        variables for which such coefficient of determination is a
        maximum. The code provided here is based on the
        wave.correlation routine in Brandon Whitcher's waveslim R
        package Version: 1.6.4, which in turn is based on wavelet
        methodology developed in Percival and Walden (2000); Gencay,
        Selcuk and Whitcher (2001) and others.
