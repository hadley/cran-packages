Description: Old statistical data was often stored in formats that are difficult to gain access to by modern statistical software. An example of this are the data-files of the `World Fertility Survey', which are stored in fixed-width format and accompanied by codebooks in a format developed by the International Statistical Institute. The read.isi package allows to gain access to these statistical data automatically, or to convert to codebook to SPSS-syntax.
