Description: A suite of tools for text and sentiment mining.  This
        includes the `mnlm' function, for sparse multinomial logistic
        regression, `pls', a concise partial least squares routine, and
        the `topics' function (beta), for efficient estimation and
        dimension selection in latent topic models.
