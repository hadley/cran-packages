Description: Out of a table comprising allelic data of at least one
        locus for several individuals and from at least two
        populations, measurements of genetic differentiation (i.e. D,
        Dest, Dest.Chao, Gst and Gst.est (Jost, 2008)) can be
        calculated. P-values and 95% confidence intervals are
        calculated according to Manly (1997) using a bootstrap method.
        Thereby, for each locus, alleles are reallocated over
        populations if they are all in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium
        (HWE). If not, the genotypes are reallocated, since alleles can
        not be assumed to be inherited independently from each other
        (Goudet, 1996). The p-values state how much the empirical found
        allocation of alleles over populations differs from an
        allocation that could arise by chance alone. In the case that
        more than two populations are compared pairwise, the p-values
        are adjusted besides using bonferroni correction in several
        other ways due to the multiple comparison from one data set.
