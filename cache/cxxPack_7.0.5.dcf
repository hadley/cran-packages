Description: Builds on the Rcpp package/library by providing an
        application layer library on the C++ side that includes models
        of fundamental R data structures like data frames and time
        series. Includes an extensible collection of tools like special
        functions and a financial date library. Extends Sweave by
        permitting vignettes (or research compendium docs) to include
        C++ code chunks. This package/library might be used to develop
        R and C++ solutions in parallel, to speed the transition from
        experimental R code to production C++ code, or to develop rich
        research compendium documents following literate statistical
        practice that have embedded R and C++ code chunks. There is a
        package vignette that provides many examples.
