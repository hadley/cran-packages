Description: TDM is designed to estimate individual pharmacokinetic
        parameters with one or more drug serum/plasma concentrations
        obtained from a single subject or multiple subjects using
        JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampling) interfaced through rjags 
        and JAGS. Besides, it also can calculate a suggested dose 
        with the target drug concentration (C ->D) or calculate a 
        predicted drug concentration with a given dose (D -> C).
