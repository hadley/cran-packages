Description: Regression modeling, testing, estimation, validation,
        graphics, prediction, and typesetting by storing enhanced model
        design attributes in the fit.  rms is a collection of about 225
        functions that assist with and streamline modeling.  It also
        contains functions for binary and ordinal logistic regression
        models and the Buckley-James multiple regression model for
        right-censored responses, and implements penalized maximum
        likelihood estimation for logistic and ordinary linear models.
        rms works with almost any regression model, but it was
        especially written to work with binary or ordinal logistic
        regression, Cox regression, accelerated failure time models,
        ordinary linear models, the Buckley-James model, generalized
        least squares for serially or spatially correlated
        observations, generalized linear models, and quantile
        regression.
