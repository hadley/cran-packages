Description: A package for analysing epidemiological data. Contains
        functions for directly and indirectly adjusting measures of
        disease frequency, quantifying measures of association on the
        basis of single or multiple strata of count data presented in a
        contingency table, and computing confidence intervals around
        incidence risk and incidence rate estimates. Miscellaneous
        functions for use in meta-analysis, diagnostic test
        interpretation, and sample size calculations.
