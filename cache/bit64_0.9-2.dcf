Description: Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit
        (signed) integers that can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays
        and data.frames. Methods are available for coercion from and to
        logicals, integers, doubles, characters and factors as well as
        many elementwise and summary functions. Many fast algorithmic
        operations such as 'match' and 'order' support interactive data
        exploration and manipulation and optionally leverage caching.
