Title: Utilities for strings and function arguments.
Author: G. Grothendieck

Description: gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function or
        certain other objects instead of the replacement string.
        Matches and back references are input to the replacement
        function and replaced by the function output.  gsubfn can be
        used to split strings based on content rather than delimiters
        and for quasi-perl-style string interpolation. The package also
        has facilities for translating formulas to functions and
        allowing such formulas in function calls instead of functions.
        This can be used with R functions such as apply, sapply,
        lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot, Filter and any other function
        that expects another function as an input argument or functions
        like cat or sql calls that may involve strings where
        substitution is desirable.
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), proto
