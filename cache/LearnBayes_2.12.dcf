Description: LearnBayes contains a collection of functions helpful in
        learning the basic tenets of Bayesian statistical inference.
        It contains functions for summarizing basic one and two
        parameter posterior distributions and predictive distributions.
        It contains MCMC algorithms for summarizing posterior
        distributions defined by the user.  It also contains functions
        for regression models, hierarchical models, Bayesian tests, and
        illustrations of Gibbs sampling.
