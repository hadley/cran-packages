Description: The functions in this package focus on analyzing
        case-control association studies involving a group of genetic
        variants.  In particular, we are interested in modeling the
        outcome variable as a function of a multivariate genetic
        profile using Bayesian model uncertainty and variable selection
        techniques.  The package incorporates functions to analyze data
        sets involving common variants as well as extensions to model
        rare variants via the Bayesian Risk Index (BRI) as well as
        haplotypes.  Finally, the package also allows the incorporation
        of external biological information to inform the marginal
        inclusion probabilities via the iBMU.
