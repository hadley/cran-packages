Package: GroupSeq
Title: Performing computations related to groupseqential boundaries.
Version: 1.1
Author: Roman Pahl
Description: The computations are done via the alpha spending approach i.e. interim 
        analyses need not to be equally spaced, and their number need not to be specified in advance. 
	It is appropriate for any trial based on normally distributed test statistics with independent 
        increments, survival studies, and certain longitudinal designs.
	Among other things it computes critical boundaries for various spending functions and for prespecified
        power and drift. Confidence intervals are also obtained.
	The package provides this in a GUI and users have option of graphical output of the results
	and/or saving desings into .html-file tables allowing further processing.
