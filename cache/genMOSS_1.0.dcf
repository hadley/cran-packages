Description: The MOSS algorithm is a Bayesian variable selection
        procedure that is applicable to GWAS data. It identifies
        combinations of the best predictive SNPs associated with the
        response. It also performs a hierarchical log-linear model
        search to identify the most relevant associations among the
        resulting subsets of SNPs.
