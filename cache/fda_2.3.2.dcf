Description: These functions were developed to support functional data
        analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W.
        (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were
        ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An
        introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and
        Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and
        Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script
        files working many examples including all but one of the 76
        figures in this latter book.  As of this release, the R-Project
        is no longer distributing the Matlab versions of the functional
        data analysis functions and sample analyses through the CRAN
        distribution system.  This is due to the pressure placed on
        storage required in the many CRAN sites by the rapidly
        increasing number of R packages, of which the fda package is
        one.  The three of us involved in this package have agreed to
        help out this situation by switching to distributing the Matlab
        functions and analyses through Jim Ramsay's ftp site at McGill
        University.  To obtain these Matlab files, go to this site
        using an ftp utility:
        http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There
        you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and
        sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions
        for installation and some additional information.
