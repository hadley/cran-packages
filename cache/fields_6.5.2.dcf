Description: Fields is for curve, surface and function fitting with an
        emphasis on splines, spatial data and spatial statistics. The
        major methods include cubic, robust, and thin plate splines,
        multivariate Kriging and Kriging for large data sets. A major
        feature is that any covariance function implemented in R can be
        used for spatial prediction. There are also many useful
        functions for plotting and working with spatial data as images.
        This package also contains an implementation of a sparse matrix
        methods for large data sets and currently requires the sparse
        matrix (spam) package for testing (but not for the standard
        spatial functions.) Use help(fields) to get started and for an
        overview.
