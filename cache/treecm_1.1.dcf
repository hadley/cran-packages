Title: Centre of mass assessment and consolidation of trees.
Author: Marco Bascietto <marco.bascietto@ibaf.cnr.it>

Description: The centre of mass is a crucial data for arborists in
        order to consolidate a tree using steel or dynamic cables.
        Given field-recorded data on branchiness of a tree, the
        package: (i) computes and plots the centre of mass of the tree
        itself, (ii) computes branches slenderness coefficient in order
        to aid the arborist identify potentially dangerous branches,
        and (iii) computes the force acting on a ground plinth and its
        best position relating to the tree centre of mass, should the
        tree need to be stabilized by a steel cable
