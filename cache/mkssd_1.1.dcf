Description: mkssd is a package that generates efficient balanced
        non-aliased multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by
        interchanging the elements of the generator vector. The package
        tries to generate a supersaturated design that has chisquare
        efficiency more than user specified efficiency level (mef). The
        package also displays the progress of generation of an
        efficient multi-level k-circulant design through a progress
        bar. The progress of 100% means that one full round of
        interchange is completed. More than one full round (typically
        4-5 rounds) of interchange may be required for larger designs.
