Description: The package contains functions to: 1) load ah files from
        Strand software and build a R data base; 2) plot different
        graphical displays of the fragment sizes obtained for each
        locus and their bins; 3) interact with graphs to sort the data
        base for a given locus and range, allowing to easily trace back
        a particular group of samples to its original Strand file; bin
        fragment size data into population genetics files.
