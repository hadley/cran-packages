Package: wethepeople
Title: An R client for interacting with the White House's "We The
        People" petition API.
Description: Implements an R client for the We The People petitions
        API. The client supports loading petitions, signatures, and
        users. Additionally, the package includes petition and
        signature data samples. There are also several functions for
        analyzing and visualizing the data. Term frequency calculations
        and word clouds are supported using the tm and wordcloud
        package, respectively. Petition and issue summary plots are
        also implemented using the ggplot2 package. For additional
        information about the We The People project, see
        https://petitions.whitehouse.gov. Note that the API limits
        requests to 10/second. For bulk data loading, please use the
        data dump provided by the White House:
