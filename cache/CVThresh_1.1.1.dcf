Description: This package carries out level-dependent cross-validation
        method for the selection of thresholding value in wavelet
        shrinkage. This procedure is implemented by coupling a
        conventional cross validation with an imputation method due to
        a limitation of data length, a power of 2. It can be easily
        applied to classical leave-one-out and k-fold cross validation.
        Since the procedure is computationally fast, a level-dependent
        cross validation can be performed for wavelet shrinkage of
        various data such as a data with correlated errors.
