Description: Calculation of the parametric, nonparametric confidence
        intervals for the difference or ratio of location parameters
        and for the difference, ratio and odds-ratio of binomial
        proportions for comparison of independent samples. CI are not
        adjusted for multiplicity. A by statement allows calculation of
        CI separately for the levels of further factors. Please note
        that, when a (generalized) linear model can be reasonably
        assumed, there are smarter methods for CI calculation available
        than are implemented in this package!
