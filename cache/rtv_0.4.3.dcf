Description: A package for conveniently representing, manipulating and
        visualising time data. Here, time is regarded as a random
        variable, and objects are used to represent realisations of
        that random variable. This is particularly useful for change
        points, irregular timeseries and failure events. There's a
        strong emphasis on continuous representations of time, with
        user-specified origins and units.
