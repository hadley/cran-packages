Description: Expert opinion (or judgment) is a body of techniques to
  estimate the distribution of a random variable when data is scarce
  or unavailable. Opinions on the quantiles of the distribution are
  sought from experts in the field and aggregated into a final
  estimate. The package supports aggregation by means of the Cooke,
  Mendel-Sheridan and predefined weights models.
