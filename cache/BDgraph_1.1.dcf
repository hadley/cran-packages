Description: BDgraph is a statistical tool for Bayessian model
        determination in Gaussian graphical models based on birth-death
        MCMC algorithm. This package includes several functions. The
        main function is 'bdmcmc' which is a brith-death MCMC algorithm
        for Bayesian model selection in Gaussian graphical models.
