Title: Control number of OpenMP threads dynamically
Description: The OpenMPController package provides a function
        'omp_set_num_threads()' to set the number of OpenMP threads to
        be used.  This may be useful, for example, when linking against
        a vendor optimised BLAS/LAPACK library (e.g. the AMD Core Math
        Library), since the defaults used by those libraries may not be
        highly performant.
