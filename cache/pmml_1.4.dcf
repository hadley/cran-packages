Description: 
        The Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) is an XML-based language
        which provides a way for applications to define statistical and data 
        mining models and to share models between PMML compliant applications. 
        More information about PMML and the Data Mining Group can be found at 
        http://www.dmg.org.
        The generated PMML can be imported into any PMML consuming application, 
        such as the Zementis ADAPA and UPPI scoring engines which allow for 
        predictive models built in R to be deployed and executed on site, in 
        the cloud (Amazon, IBM, and FICO), in-database (IBM Netezza, Pivotal, 
        Sybase IQ, Teradata and Teradata Aster) or Hadoop (Datameer and Hive).
