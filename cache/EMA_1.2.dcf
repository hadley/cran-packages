Title: Easy Microarray data Analysis

Description: Based on the experience of biostatisticians of Institut
        Curie, we propose both a clear analysis strategy and a
        selection of tools to investigate microarray gene expression
        data. The most usual and relevant existing R functions were
        discussed, validated and gathered in an easy-to-use R package
        (EMA) devoted to gene expression microarray analysis. These
        functions were improved for ease of use, enhanced visualisation
        and better interpretation of results.
