Description: Random number generation for the truncated multivariate
        normal and Student t distribution. Computes probabilities,
        quantiles and densities, including one-dimensional and
        bivariate marginal densities. Computes first and second moments
        (i.e. mean and covariance matrix) for the double-truncated
        multinormal case.
