Title: Diagnostic tools for two-level normal hierarchical linear models

Description: A suite of diagnostic tools for two-level normal
        hierarchical linear models. The package offers not only
        traditional case-deletion diagnostics (Cook's distance,
        covratio, covtrace, and MDFFITS) but also provides graphics for
        residual analysis. Currently, case deletion is performed by
        iteratively refitting the model using lmer in the lme4 package,
        so for data sets with many groups, computation is currently
        slow.
Depends: methods, lme4, MASS, ggplot2, plyr, reshape
