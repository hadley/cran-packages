Description: infoDecompuTE is a package designed specifically for
        studying the analysis of variance (ANOVA) table of the
        two-phase experiments. By inputting the design and the
        relationships of the random and fixed factors using the
        Wilkinson-Rogers syntax, EMSVarComp can generate the structure
        of the ANOVA table with the coefficients of the variance
        components for the expected mean squares. This package can also
        study the balance incomplete block design and provides the
        efficiency factors with the ANOVA table.
