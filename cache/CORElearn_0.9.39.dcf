Description: CORElearn is machine learning suite ported to R from
        standalone C++ package.  It contains several model learning
        techniques in classification and regression, for example
        classification and regression trees with optional constructive
        induction and models in the leafs, random forests, kNN, naive
        Bayes, and locally weighted regression.  It is especially
        strong in feature evaluation algorithms where it contains
        several variants of Relief algorithm and many impurity based
        attribute evaluation functions, e.g., Gini, information gain,
        MDL, DKM, ...  Its additional strength is ordEval algorithm and
        its visualization used for ordinal features and class.  Several
        algorithms support parallel multithreaded execution via OpenMP.
        Windows binary versions supporting multithreading are available
        on package website, as CRAN uses different toolchain.  The top
        level documentation is reachable through ?CORElearn.
