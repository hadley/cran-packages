Description: Provides methods for sensory discrimination methods;
        duotrio, triangle, 2-AFC, 3-AFC, A-not A, same-different and
        2-AC. This enables the calculation of d-primes, standard errors
        of d-primes, sample size and power computations, and
        comparisons of different d-primes. Methods for profile
        likelihood confidence intervals and plotting are included.
