Description: 
  This package contains functions to perform inference via
  simulation from the posterior distributions for Bayesian nonparametric and
  semiparametric models. Although the name of the package was motivated
  by the Dirichlet Process prior, the package considers and will consider
  other priors on functional spaces. So far, DPpackage includes models 
  considering Dirichlet Process, Polya Trees, Mixtures of Triangular distributions, 
  and Random Bernstein polynomials priors. The package
  also includes models considering Penalized B-Splines.
  Currently the package includes semiparametric models for density estimation, ROC curve analysis,
  interval censored data, binary regression models, generalized linear mixed 
  models, IRT type models, and generalized additive models. The package also contains functions 
  to compute Pseudo-Bayes factors for model comparison, and to elicitate the precision 
  parameter of the Dirichlet Process. To maximize computational efficiency, 
  the actual sampling for each model is done in compiled FORTRAN. The functions 
  return objects which can be subsequently analyzed with functions provided in 
  the coda package.
