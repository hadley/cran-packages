Description: polysat is a collection of tools to handle microsatellite
        data of any ploidy (and samples of mixed ploidy) where allele
        copy number is not known in partially heterozygous genotypes.
        It can import and export data in ABI GeneMapper, Structure,
        ATetra, Tetrasat/Tetra, GenoDive, SPAGeDi, POPDIST, STRand, and
        binary presence/absence formats.  It can calculate pairwise
        distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model
        or infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and
        allele frequencies into account.  These distances can be used
        for the calculation of clonal diversity statistics or used for
        further analysis in R.  Allelic diversity statistics are also
        available.  polysat can assist the user in estimating the
        ploidy of samples, and lastly it can estimate allele
        frequencies in populations, calculate pairwise Fst values based
        on those frequencies, and export allele frequencies to SPAGeDi
        and adegenet.
