Title: Choi and Hall Clustering in 3d
Version: 0.3
Author: Douglas G. Woolford <dgwoolfo@uwo.ca>
Description: Functions that cluster 1-3 dimensional data into their
        local modes.  Based on a convergent form of Choi and Hall's
        (1999) data sharpening method.  Note: sharp3dB is much faster
        than sharp3d if data is ordered in at least one dimension.
