Description: This package contains tools to fit point process models with sequences of LASSO penalties ("regularisation paths"). Regularisation paths of Poisson point process models or area-interaction models can be fitted with LASSO, adaptive LASSO or elastic net penalties. A number of criteria are available to judge the bias-variance tradeoff.
