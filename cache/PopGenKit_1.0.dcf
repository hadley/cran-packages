Description: There are two main purposes to this package. The first is
        to allow batch conversion of Genepop (Rousset 2008) input files
        for use with Arlequin (Excoffier and Lischer 2010), which has a
        simple GUI to analyze batch files. Two commonly used simulation
        software, BottleSim (Kuo & Janzen 2003) and Easypop (Balloux
        2001) produce Genepop output files that can be analyzed this
        way. There are also functions to convert to and from BottleSim
        format, to quickly produce allele frequency tables or to
        convert a file directly for use in ordination analyses (e.g.
        principal component analysis). This package also includes
        functions to calculate allele rarefaction curves, confidence
        intervals on heterozygosity and allelic richness with
        resampling strategies (bootstrap and jackknife).
