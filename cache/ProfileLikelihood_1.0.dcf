Description: This package provides profile likelihoods for a parameter
        of interest in commonly used statistical models. The models
        include linear models, generalized linear models, proportional
        odds models, linear mixed-effects models, and linear models for
        longitudinal responses fitted by generalized least squares. The
        package also provides plots for normalized profile likelihoods
        as well as the maximum profile likelihood estimates and the kth
        likelihood support intervals.
