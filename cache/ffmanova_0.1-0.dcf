Description: This package performs general linear modeling with multiple
 responses (MANCOVA).  An overall p-value for each model term is calculated
 by the 50-50 MANOVA method, which handles collinear responses.  Rotation
 testing is used to compute adjusted single response p-values according to
 familywise error rates and false discovery rates.
