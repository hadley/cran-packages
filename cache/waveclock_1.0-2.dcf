Description: waveclock is an R function designed to assess the period and
  amplitude of cycling cell luminescence data. The function reconstructs
  the modal frequencies from a continuous wavelet decomposition of the
  luminescence data using the 'crazy climbers' algorithm described in
  "Practical Time-Frequency Analysis: Gabor and Wavelet Transforms with
  an Implementation in S", by Rene Carmona, Wen L. Hwang and Bruno
  Torresani, Academic Press, 1998.
