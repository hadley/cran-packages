Description: Direct interface to Octave. The primary goal is to
        facilitate the port of Matlab/Octave scripts to R. The package
        enables to call any Octave functions from R and as well as
        browsing their documentation, passing variables between R and
        Octave, using R core RNGs in Octave, which ensure stochastic
        computations are also reproducible.
