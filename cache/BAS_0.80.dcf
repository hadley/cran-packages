Description: Package for Bayesian Model Averaging in linear models
        using stochastic or deterministic sampling without replacement
        from posterior distributions. Prior distributions on
        coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors
        corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the Liang et
        al hyper-g priors (JASA 2008). Other model selection criterian
        include AIC and BIC. Sampling probabilities may be updated
        based on the sampled models. Allows uniform or beta-binomial
        prior distributions on models.
