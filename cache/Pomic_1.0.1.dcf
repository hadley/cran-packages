Description: This package propose calculations of an information
        criterion to check the quality of simulations results of
        ABM/IBM or other non-linear rule-based models. The POMDEV
        measure is based on the KL divergence and likelihood theory. It
        basically indicates the deviance of simulation results from
        field observations. Once POMDEV scores and metropolis-hasting
        sampling on different model versions are effectuated, POMIC
        scores can be calculated. This method is still under
        development and further work are needed for the incorporation
        of multiple patterns assessment.
