Description: The package EasyABC enables to launch a series of
        simulations of a computer code from the R platform, and to
        retrieve the simulation outputs in an appropriate format for
        post-processing treatments. Four sequential sampling schemes
        and three coupled-to-MCMC schemes are implemented.
