Description: The package contains HingeBoost for binary and multi-class
        classification with unequal misclassification costs. Functional
        gradient descent algorithm to optimize the cost-sensitive hinge
        loss. The algorithm can fit linear classifier with linear least
        squares, nonlinear classifer with smoothing spline (or trees)
        as base learner.
