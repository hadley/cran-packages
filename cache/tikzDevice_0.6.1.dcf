Title: A Device for R Graphics Output in PGF/TikZ Format
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Charlie Sharpsteen and Cameron Bracken
Description: The TikZ device enables LaTeX-ready output from R graphics
        functions. This is done by producing code that can be
        understood by the TikZ graphics language. All text in a graphic
        output with the tikz() function will can be typeset by LaTeX
        and therefore will match whatever fonts are currently used in
        the document. This also means that LaTeX mathematics can be
        typeset directly into labels and annotations!  Graphics
        produced this way can also be annotated with custom TikZ
        commands.
