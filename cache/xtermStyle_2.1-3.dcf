Description: Text formatting in xterm and ansi terminals using escape
        sequences. Supports colors and various font styles. It began as
        a standalone version of the ‘xterm256’ package by Romain
        Francois since that package is tangled up with the syntax
        highlighting package ‘highlight’ but has been developed in
        another direction since then.  For some more sophisticated
        examples of this package functionality check out the ‘dataview’
        package as that was the very reason ‘xtermStyle’ came into
        existence. However as ‘xtermStyle’ can be used independently
        they were released separately.
