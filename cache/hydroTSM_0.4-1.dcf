Description: S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and
        plotting of time series used in hydrology and related
        environmental sciences. In particular, this package is highly
        oriented to hydrological modelling tasks. The focus of this
        package has been put in providing a collection of tools useful
        for the daily work of hydrologists (although an effort was made
        to optimise each function as much as possible, functionality
        has had priority over speed). Bugs / comments / questions /
        collaboration of any kind are very welcomed, and in particular,
        datasets that can be included in this package for academic
        purposes.
