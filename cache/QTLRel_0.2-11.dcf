Title: Tools for mapping of quantitative traits of genetically related
        individuals and calculating identity coefficients from a
        pedigree

Description: This software provides tools for quantitative trait
        mapping in populations such as advanced intercross lines where
        relatedness among individuals should not be ignored. It can
        estimate background genetic variance components, impute missing
        genotypes, simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan for
        putative quantitative trait loci (QTL), and plot mapping
        results. It also has functions to calculate identity
        coefficients from pedigrees, especially suitable for pedigrees
        that consist of a large number of generations, or estimate
        identity coefficients from genotypic data in certain
        circumstances.
