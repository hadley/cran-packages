Description: TRAMPR is an R package for matching terminal restriction
        fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) profiles between unknown
        samples and a database of knowns.  TRAMPR facilitates analysis
        of many unknown profiles at once, and provides tools for
        working directly with electrophoresis output through to
        generating summaries suitable for community analyses with R's
        rich set of statistical functions.  TRAMPR also resolves the
        issues of multiple TRFLP profiles within a species, and shared
        TRFLP profiles across species.
