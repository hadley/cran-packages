Description: Phylogenetic clustering (phyloclustering) is an evolutionary
        Continuous Time Markov Chain model-based approach to identify
        population structure from molecular data without assuming
        linkage equilibrium. It provides a convenient implementation of
        phyloclustering for DNA and SNP data, capable of clustering individuals
        into subpopulations and identifying molecular sequences representative
        of those subpopulations. It is designed in C for performance,
        interfaced with R for visualization, and incorporates other popular
        open source software, ms, seq-gen and Hap-Clustering for simulating
        data and additional analyses. See the phyclust website for more
        information, documentations and examples.
