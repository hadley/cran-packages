Title: Interface to Snowball implementation of Porter's word stemming
        algorithm.
Description: An R interface to the C code that implements Porter's word
        stemming algorithm for collapsing words to a common root to aid
        comparison of texts.  There is code to for different languages
        (i.e. danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german,
        norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish, swedish). However,
        these may not be applicable if the words require UTF encoding.
        This is extensible by allowing different routines to be
        specified to create the C routines used in the stemming,
        permitting debugging, profiling, pool management, caching, etc.

Note: This package is setup to support stemming for languages other
        than English and to dynamically fetch code for languages from
        the Snowball web site. The inst/scripts/download script fetches
        the code for languages supported by Snowball and includes it in
        the distribution.  Support for Unicode is needed in R.
