Description: The HOPACH clustering algorithm builds a hierarchical
        tree of clusters by recursively partitioning a data set, while
        ordering and possibly collapsing clusters at each level. The
        algorithm uses the Mean/Median Split Silhouette (MSS) criteria
        to identify the level of the tree with maximally homogeneous
        clusters. It also runs the tree down to produce a final
        ordered list of the elements. The non-parametric bootstrap
        allows one to estimate the probability that each element
        belongs to each cluster (fuzzy clustering).
