Description: This software has evolved from fisheries research
        conducted at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo,
        British Columbia, Canada. It extends the R language to include
        two-dimensional plotting features similar to those commonly
        available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).  Embedded C
        code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
        finding polygons that contain specified point events or
        converting between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse
        Mercator (UTM) coordinates.  Additionally, we include C++ code
        developed by Angus Johnson for the Clipper library.  PBSmapping
        also includes data for a global shoreline and other data sets
        in the public domain.  The R directory
        '.../library/PBSmapping/doc' offers a complete user's guide
        PBSmapping-UG.pdf, which should be consulted to use all
        functions in the package effectively.
