Depends: R (>= 2.9.0), stats
Description: The package contains functions (1) for calculating power,
        sample size, and minimal detectable mediation effect for
        testing mediation effect in linear, logistic, Poisson, or cox
        regression; (2) for calculating power, sample size, and minimal
        detectable slope for testing the slope in a simple linear
        regression (only one predictor); (3) for calculating power, and
        sample size for testing odds ratio in a simple logistic
        regression with continuous predictor or binary predictor.
