Description: Statistical models of biased sampling in the form of
        univariate and multivariate noncentral hypergeometric
        distributions, including Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric
        distribution and Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric
        distribution (also called extended hypergeometric
        distribution). See vignette("UrnTheory") for explanation of
        these distributions.
