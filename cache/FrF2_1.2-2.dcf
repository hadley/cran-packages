Description: This package creates regular and non-regular Fractional
        Factorial designs. Furthermore, analysis tools for Fractional
        Factorial designs with 2-level factors are offered (main
        effects and interaction plots for all factors simultaneously,
        cube plot for looking at the simultaneous effects of three
        factors, full or half normal plot, alias structure in a more
        readable format than with the built-in function alias). The
        package is currently subject to intensive development. While
        much of the intended functionality is already available, some
        changes and improvements are still to be expected. Suggestions
        are welcome.
