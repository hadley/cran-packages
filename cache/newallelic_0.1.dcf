Author: Karl Forner <Karl.Forner@gmail.com>

Description: This is the implementation in R+C of a new association
	test described in "A fast, unbiased and exact allelic exact test
	for case-control association studies" (Submitted).
	It appears that in most cases the classical chi-square test used
	for testing for allelic association on genotype data is biased.
	Our test is unbiased, exact but fast throught careful optimization.
