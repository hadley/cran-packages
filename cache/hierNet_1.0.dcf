Title: A Lasso for Hierarchical Interactions
Version: 1.0
Author: Jacob Bien and Rob Tibshirani
Description: Fits sparse interaction models for continuous and binary
        responses subject to the strong (or weak) hierarchy restriction
        that an interaction between two variables only be included if
        both (or at least one of) the variables is included as a main
        effect.  For more details, see Bien, J., Taylor, J.,
        Tibshirani, R., (2012) "A Lasso for Hierarchical Interactions"
        submitted.
