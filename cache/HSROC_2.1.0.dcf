Description: This package implements a model for joint meta-analysis of
        sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test under
        evaluation, while taking into account the possibly imperfect
        sensitivity and specificity of the reference test. This
        hierarchical model accounts for both within and between study
        variability. Estimation is carried out using a Bayesian
        approach, implemented via a Gibbs sampler. The model can be
        applied in situations where more than one reference test is
        used in the selected studies.
