Description: CORElearn is machine learning suite ported to R from
        standalone C++ package. It contains several model learning
        techniques in classification and regression, for example
        classification and regression trees with optional constructive
        induction and models in the leafs, random forests, kNN, naive
        Bayes, and locally weighted regression. It is especially strong
        in feature evaluation algorithms where it contains several
        variants of Relief algorithm and many impurity based attribute
        evaluation functions, e.g., Gini, information gain, MDL, DKM,
        ... Its additional strength is ordEval algorithm and its
        visualization used for ordinal features and class. Several
        algorithms support parallel multithreaded execution via OpenMP.
        The top level documentation is reachable through ?CORElearn.
