        doses in a microarray experiment.

Description: Several testing procedures including the global likelihood ratio test 
  (Bartholomew, 1961), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976), M (Hu et al. 2005) and 
  the modified M (Lin et al. 2007) are used to test for the monotonic trend in gene 
  expression with respect to doses. BH (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) and BY 
  (Benjamini and Yekutilie 2004) FDR controlling procedures are applied to adjust the 
  raw p-values obtained from the permutations.
