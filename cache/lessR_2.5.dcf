Description: Each function accomplishes the work of several or more
        standard R functions.  For example, two function calls, Read()
        and CountAll(), read the data and generate descriptive
        statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus histograms
        and bar charts as appropriate.  Other functions provide for
        descriptive statistics, a comprehensive regression analysis,
        ANOVA and t-test, color plotting, color bar chart, color
        histogram, color box plot, color density curves, a calibrated
        power curve, and the reading and display of csv and other
        formatted data. The function Help provides a help system that
        suggests specific analyses and functions. Variable labels, and
        color themes with the set function, are also available. A
        confirmatory factor analysis of multiple indicator measurement
        models is also available as well as pedagogical routines for
        data simulation such as for the Central Limit Theorem.
