Description: A collection of functions to support matrix calculations
        as presented in Magnus and Neudecker (1999). There are
        additional functions that are comparable to APL functions which
        are useful for actuarial models and calculations.  This package
        is used for teaching and research purposes at the Department of
        Finance and Risk Engineering, New York University, Polytechnic
        Institute, Brooklyn, NY 11201.
