Description: The Anderson-Darling K-sample test can be used to test
        whether several independent random samples of various sizes
        come from the same but unspecified continuous distribution. It
        is a rank test and consistent against all alternatives. A low
        to moderate number of tied observations can be tolerated. The
        combination of such tests can be used to test whether M groups
        of samples (with K allowed to vary from group to group) come
        from respective common distributions, which may vary from group
        to group. This is useful in testing for treatment effects in
        randomized (incomplete) block designs or in examining whether
        several laboratories perform equally well when asked to measure
        a sufficient number of test speciments from different batches
        or materials.
