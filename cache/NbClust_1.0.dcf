Description: This package provides most of the popular indices for
        cluster validation ready to use for the outputs produced by
        functions coming from the same package. It also proposes to
        user the best clustering scheme from the different results
        obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters,
        distance measures, and clustering methods.
