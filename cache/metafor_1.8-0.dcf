Description: The metafor package provides a comprehensive collection of
        functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package
        includes functions to calculate various effect size or outcome
        measures, fit fixed-, random-, and mixed-effects models to such
        data, carry out moderator and meta-regression analyses, and
        create various types of meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest,
        funnel, radial, and L'Abbe plots). For meta-analyses of 2x2
        tables, proportions, incidence rates, and incidence rate
        ratios, the package also provides functions that implement
        specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method,
        Peto's method, and a variety of suitable generalized linear
        (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects (conditional)
        logistic and Poisson regression models).
