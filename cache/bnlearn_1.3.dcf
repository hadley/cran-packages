Description: Bayesian network structure learning via constraint-based
        (also known as 'conditional independence') and score-based
        algorithms. This package implements the Grow-Shrink (GS)
        algorithm, the Incremental Association (IAMB) algorithm, the
        Interleaved-IAMB (Inter-IAMB) algorithm, the Fast-IAMB
        (Fast-IAMB) algorithm, the Max-Min Parents and Children (MMPC)
        algorithm and the Hill-Climbing (HC) greedy search algorithm
        for both discrete and Gaussian networks, along with many score
        functions and conditional independence tests. Some utility
        functions (model comparison and manipulation, random data
        generation, arc orientation testing, simple ad advanced plots)
        are also included.
