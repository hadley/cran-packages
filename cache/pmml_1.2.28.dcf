Description: The Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML) is a
        language for representing models using XML in an application
        independent way. Such models can then be shared with other
        applications that support PMML (see
        http://www.dmg.org/products.html). The generic pmml() function
        takes an R model as its argument and returns the corresponding
        PMML.  Currently supported models for export include linear
        regression (lm and glm), support vector machines (ksvm),
        decision trees (rpart), neural networks (nnet, multinom),
        association rules (arules), survival models (coxph, survreg),
        random survival forests (randomSurvivalForest), and clusters
        (kmeans, hclust).
