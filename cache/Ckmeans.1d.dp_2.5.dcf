Description: This package implements a dynamic programming algorithm to
        cluster one-dimensional data optimally, by minimizing the sum
        of squares of within-cluster distances.  As an alternative to
        the heuristic k-means algorithm, the algorithm guarantees
        optimality and repeatability of clustering.
