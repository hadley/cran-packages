Description: Nimrod generates a Latin Hypercube Design using the
        emulator package. Based on this design, any function can be
        evaluated on the design points. A generalisation of the
        Nimrod/O test case is included. A Gaussian model can be fit to
        the data using the mlegp package. The resulting surface can be
        viewed using a wireframe plot with choice of viewing and
        conditioning variables and levels.
