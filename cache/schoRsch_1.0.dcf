Description: The package offers a helping hand to psychologists and
        other behavioral scientists who routinely deal with
        experimental data from factorial experiments. It includes
        several functions to format output from other R functions
        according to the style guidelines of the APA (American
        Psychological Association). This formatted output can be copied
        directly into manuscripts to facilitate data reporting. These
        features are backed up by a toolkit of several small helper
        functions, e.g., offering out-of-the-box outlier removal. The
        package lends its name to Georg "Schorsch" Schuessler,
        ingenious technician at the Department of Psychology III,
        University of Wuerzburg.
