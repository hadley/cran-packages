Description: This package is a supplement to OpenIntro Statistics,
        which is a free textbook available at openintro.org (at-cost
        paperbacks are also available for under $10 on Amazon). The
        package contains data sets used in the textbook along with
        custom plotting functions for reproducing book figures. Note
        that many functions and examples include color transparency.
        Some plotting elements may not show up properly (or at all) in
        some Windows versions.
