Description: Testing SNPs and SNP interactions with a genotypic TDT.
        This package furthermore contains functions for computing
        pairwise values of LD measures and for identifying LD blocks,
        as well as functions for setting up matched case pseudo-control
        genotype data for case-parent trios in order to run trio logic
        regreesion, to impute missing genotypes in trios, or to
        simulate case-parent trios with disease risk dependent on SNP
        interaction.
