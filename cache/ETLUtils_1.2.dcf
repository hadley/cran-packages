        package ff) on large data.
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Jan Wijffels
Description: Provides functions to facilitate the use of the ff package
        in interaction with bigdata in SQL databases (e.g. in
        Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL/Hive) by allowing easy importing
        directly into ffdf objects using DBI, RODBC and RJDBC. Also
        contains some basic utility functions to do fast left outer
        join merging based on match and basic recoding.
