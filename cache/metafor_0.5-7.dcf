Description: The metafor package consists of a collection of functions
        for conducting meta-analyses in R. Fixed- and random-effects
        models (with and without moderators) can be fitted via the
        general linear (mixed-effects) model. For 2x2 table data, the
        Mantel-Haenszel and Peto's method are also implemented.
