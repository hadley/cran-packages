Description: Fits Bayesian mixture models to estimate marker dosage for
        dominant markers on autopolyploids using JAGS (1.0 or greater)
        as outlined in Baker et al (2010). May be used in conjunction
        with polySegratio for simulation studies and comparison with
        standard methods.
