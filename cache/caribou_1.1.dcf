Description: This is a package for estimating the population size of
        migratory caribou herds based on large scale aggregations
        monitored by radio telemetry. It implements the methodology
        found in the article by Rivest et al. (1998) about caribou
        abundance estimation. It also includes a function based on the
        Lincoln-Petersen Index as applied to radio telemetry data by
        White and Garrott (1990).
