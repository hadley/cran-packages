Description: This package generates Reversible Jump MCMC (RJ-MCMC)
        sampling for approximating the posterior distribution of a time
        varying regulatory network, under the Auto Regressive TIme
        VArying (ARTIVA) model (for a detailed description of the
        algorithm, see Lebre et al. BMC Systems Biology, 2010).
        Starting from time-course gene expression measurements for a
        gene of interest (referred to as "target gene") and a set of
        genes (referred to as "parent genes") which may explain the
        expression of the target gene, the ARTIVA procedure identifies
        temporal segments for which a set of interactions occur between
        the "parent genes" and the "target gene". The time points that
        delimit the different temporal segments are referred to as
        changepoints (CP).
