Description: This package is based on the code of the rpart package.
        It extends rpart by adding additional splitting methods
        emphasizing interpretable/parsimonious trees.  Unless indicated
        otherwise, it is safe to assume that all functions herein are
        extensions of or copied directly from similar or nearly
        identical rpart methods.  As such, the authors of rpart are
        authors of this package as well.  However, please direct any
        error reports or other questions about itree to the maintainer
        of this package; they are welcome and appreciated.
