Description: This package contains the current version of the Open
        Perimetry Interface (OPI), for controlling visual field
        machines using R. The OPI is a standard for interfacing with
        visual field testing machines (perimeters). It specifies basic
        functions that allow many visual field tests to be constructed.
        As of June 2012 it is partially implemented on the Octopus 900
        and the Heidelberg Edge Perimeter. Note to use these two
        machines you will need either the Rhep or OPIOctopus900
        packages which require permission from the respective companies
        to obtain: see the OPI www site. It also has a cousin: the R
        package visualFields, which has tools for analysing and
        manipulating visual field data.
