Description: Statistical models and utilities for the analysis of word frequency distributions.
	The utilities include functions for loading, manipulating and visualizing word frequency
	data and vocabulary growth curves.  The package also implements several statistical 
	models for the distribution of word frequencies in a population.  (The name of this library
        derives from the most famous word frequency distribution, Zipf's law.)
