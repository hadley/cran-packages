Description: This package provides functions for performing
        differential expression analysis using differentially expressed
        gene elimination strategy. A simple unified interface is
        provided which encapsulates functions to calculate
        normalization factors and estimate differentially expressed
        genes defined in edgeR, baySeq, and DESeq packages.  The
        appropriate combination provided by TCC allows a more robust
        and accurate estimation performed easily than directly using
        original packages.  Functions to produce simulation data under
        various conditions and to plot the data are also provided.
