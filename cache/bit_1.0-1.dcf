Description: bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs), 
  coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; 
  fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics. 
  With bit vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the 
  expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less 
  RAM and factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. With this speed gain it 
  even pays-off to convert to bit in order to avoid a single boolean operation 
  on logicals or a single set operation on (longer) integer subscripts, the 
  pay-off is dramatic when such components are used more than once. 
  Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing 
  standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package 
  allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call() 
  directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector 
  memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying 
  from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a performance 
  penalty of 150%.
