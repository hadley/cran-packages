Description: This is a two-in-one package which provides interfaces to
        both R and Python. It implements fast hierarchical,
        agglomerative clustering routines. Part of the functionality is
        designed as drop-in replacement for existing routines:
        “linkage” in the SciPy package “scipy.cluster.hierarchy”,
        “hclust” in R's “stats” package, and the “flashClust” package.
        It provides the same functionality, with the benefit of a much
        faster implementation. Moreover, there are memory-saving
        routines for clustering of vector data, which go beyond what
        the existing packages provide. For information on how to
        install the Python files, see the file INSTALL in the source
        distribution.
