Description: Algorithms for time series analysis from nonlinear
        dynamical systems theory originally made available by Rainer
        Hegger, Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber at the site
        http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/ .  A related R
        package (tseriesChaos by Antonio, Fabio Di Narzo) contains
        rewritten versions of a few of the TISEAN algorithms.  The
        intention of the present package is to use the TISEAN routines
        from within R with no need of manual importing/exporting.  It
        is in a beta version state, though most of the functions should
        be usable.  Correspondence should be sent to either Marji
        Lines, lines@dss.uniud.it, or to the current maintainer of the
        package. This package only contains R interface code. It
        requires that you have the Tisean-3.0.1 algorithms available on
        your computer.
