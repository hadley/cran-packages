Description: polysat is a collection of tools to handle microsatellite
        data of any ploidy (and samples of mixed ploidy) where allele
        copy number is not known in partially heterozygous genotypes.
        It can import and export data in ABI GeneMapper, Structure,
        ATetra, Tetrasat/Tetra, GenoDive, SPAGeDi, POPDIST, and binary
        presence/absence formats.  It can calculate pairwise distances
        between individuals using a stepwise mutation model or infinite
        alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and allele
        frequencies into account.  These distances can be used for the
        calculation of clonal diversity statistics or used for further
        analysis in R.  polysat can also assist the user in estimating
        the ploidy of samples, and lastly it can estimate allele
        frequencies in populations, calculate pairwise Fst values based
        on those frequencies, and export allele frequencies to SPAGeDi
        and adegenet.
