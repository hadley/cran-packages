Title: Tools for mapping of quantitative traits of genetically related
        individuals
Author: Riyan Cheng <rcheng@uchicago.edu>

Description: This software provides tools for quantiative trait mapping
        in populations such as advanced intercross lines where
        relatedness among individuals should be accounted for. It can
        estimate background genetic variances, impute missing
        genotypes, simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan for
        putative quantitative trait loci (QTL), and plot mapping
        results.
