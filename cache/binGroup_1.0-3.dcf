Description: This package provides methods for estimation and
        hypothesis testing of proportions in group testing designs.
        Currently, methods of estimating a proportion in a single
        population, as well as hypothesis tests and functions for
        experimental design for this situation are provided. Further,
        regression methods are implemented for simple pooling and
        matrix pooling designs.
