Title: Entropy reweighting to create balanced samples

Description: Package implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing procedure that allows users to reweight a dataset such that the covariate distributions in the reweighted data satisfy a set of user specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create balanced samples in observational studies with a binary treatment where the control group data can be reweighted to  match the covariate moments in the treatment group. Entropy balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample to known characteristics from a target population.
