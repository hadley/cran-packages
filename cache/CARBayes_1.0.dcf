Description: This package implements Bayesian hierarchical spatial
        areal unit models. In such models the spatial correlation is
        modelled by a set of random effects, which are assigned a
        conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. Examples
        of the models included are the BYM model as well as recently
        developed localised spatial smoothing models. In addition, a
        Moran's permutation test can be implemented.
