Description: This package computes Bayesian estimates for additive and
        multiplicative effects (AME) models for networks and relational
        data. The basic model includes regression terms, the covariance
        structure of the social relations model (Warner, Kenny and
        Stoto (1979), Wong (1982)), and multiplicative factor effects
        (Hoff(2009)). Four different link functions accomodate
        different relational data structures, including binary/network
        data (bin), normal relational data (nrm), ordinal relational
        data (ord) and data from fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn).
