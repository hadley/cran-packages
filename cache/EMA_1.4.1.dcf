Description: We propose both a clear analysis strategy and a selection
        of tools to investigate microarray gene expression data. The
        most usual and relevant existing R functions were discussed,
        validated and gathered in an easy-to-use R package (EMA)
        devoted to gene expression microarray analysis. These functions
        were improved for ease of use, enhanced visualisation and
        better interpretation of results.
