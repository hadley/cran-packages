Description: Set of hydrological functions including an R
        implementation of the hydrological model TOPMODEL, which is
        based on the 1995 FORTRAN version by Keith Beven. From version
        0.7.0, the package is put into maintenance mode. New functions
        for hydrological analysis are now developed as part of the
        RHydro package. RHydro can be found on R-forge and is built on
        a set of dedicated S4 classes.
