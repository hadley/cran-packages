Title: Extensible Markov Model (EMM) for Data Stream Clustering in R
Author: Michael Hahsler and Margaret H. Dunham
Maintainer: Michael Hahsler <michael@hahsler.net>
Description: This package implements TRACDS (Temporal Relationships
        between Clusters for Data Streams) which is a generalization of
        Extensible Markov Model (EMM). TRACDS adds a temporal or order
        model to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically
        adapting Markov Chain. This package implements EMM (TRACDS on
        top of tNN data stream clustering). Development of this package
        was supported in part by NSF IIS-0948893 and R21HG005912 from
        the National Human Genome Research Institute.
