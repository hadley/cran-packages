Title: Adaptive Mixture of Student-t distributions

Suggests: coda
Description: This package provides functions to perform the fitting of
        an adaptive mixture of Student-t distributions to a target
        density through its kernel function. The mixture approximation
        can then be used as the importance density in importance
        sampling or as the candidate density in the Metropolis-Hastings
        algorithm to obtain quantities of interest for the target
        density itself.
