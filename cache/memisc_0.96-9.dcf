Description: One of the aims of this package is to make life easier for
        useRs who deal with survey data sets. It provides an
        infrastructure for the management of survey data including
        value labels, definable missing values, recoding of variables,
        production of code books, and import of (subsets of) SPSS and
        Stata files. Further, it provides functionality to produce
        tables and data frames of arbitrary descriptive statistics and
        (almost) publication-ready tables of regression model
        estimates. Also some convenience tools for graphics,
        programming, and simulation are provided.
