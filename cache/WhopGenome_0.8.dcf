Depends: R (>= 1.8.0)
Suggests: RMySQL, DBI, AnnotationDbi
Description: WhopGenome's primary focus lies in reading SNP and InDel data from
	Variant Call Format files as fast as possible. Several optimisation and design
	choices allow to read 4000+ SNPs / second.
	It also reads in alignments from FASTA, Phylip, MAF and other file formats.
	Provides simple interfaces to query genome annotation from UCSC and
	Bioconductor, gene ontology data from AmiGO and process .PED-format pedigree files.

        has been slightly modified to conform to R package development
        requirements such as removal or replacement of printf, fprintf

        session by R-supplied equivalents as well as modifications that
        eliminate most compiler warnings.
