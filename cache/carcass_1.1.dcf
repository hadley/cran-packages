Description: The number of bird or bat fatalities from collisions with buildings, towers or wind energy turbines can be estimated based on carcass searches and experimentally assessed carcass persistence times and searcher efficiency. This package provides diverse functions for estimating the probability that a bird or bat that died is found by a searcher. It further provides a function to obtain a posterior distribution of the number of fatalities based on the number of carcasses found and the estimated detection probability.
