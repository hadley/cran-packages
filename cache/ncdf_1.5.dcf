Title: Interface to Unidata netCDF data files
Maintainer:  David Pierce <dpierce@ucsd.edu>
Version: 1.5
Author: David Pierce
Description: This package provides a high-level R interface to Unidata's
 netCDF data files, which are portable across platforms and include
 metadata information in addition to the data sets.  
 Using this package netCDF files can be opened and data sets read in easily.
 It is also easy to create new netCDF dimensions, variables, and files,
 or manipulate existing netCDF files.
 This interface provides considerably more functionality than the old "netCDF"
 package for R, and is not compatible with the old "netCDF" package for R.
 Release 1.2 adds better support for character variables, and miscellaneous
 bug fixes.  Release 1.3 is for miscellaneous bug fixes, and improves the
 documentation.  Release 1.4 improves the efficiency, and adds small bug
 fixes.  Release 1.5 adds support for byte variables, plus small bug fixes.
