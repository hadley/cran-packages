Description: This package gives an interface to handle hyperspectral
        data sets in R. I.e. spatially or time-resolved spectra, or
        spectra with any other kind of information associated with the
        spectra. The spectra can be data as obtained in XRF, UV/VIS,
        Fluorescence, AES, NIR, IR, Raman, NMR, MS, etc. More
        generally, any data that is recorded over a discretized
        variable, e.g. absorbance = f (wavelength), stored as a vector
        of absorbance values for discrete wavelengths is suitable.
