Description: Alternating least squares is often used to resolve components contributing to data with a bilinear structure; the basic technique may be extended to alternating constrained least squares.  Commonly applied constraints include unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of components.  Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by assuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear decomposition is shared between datasets.
