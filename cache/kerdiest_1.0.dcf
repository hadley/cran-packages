Description: Nonparametric kernel distribution function estimation is
        performed. Three automatic bandwidth selection methods for
        nonparametric kernel distribution function estimation are
        implemented: the plug-in of Altman and Leger, the plug-in of
        Polansky and Baker, and the modified cross-validation of
        Bowman, Hall and Prvan. The exceedence function, the mean
        return period and the return level are also computed.
