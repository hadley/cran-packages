Maintainer: David Clifford <david.clifford@csiro.au>
Description: Functions to fit Gaussian linear model by maximising the residual log likelihood where the covariance structure can be written as a linear combination of known matrices.  Can be used for multivariate models and random effects models.  Easy straight forward manner to specify random effects models, including random interactions.
