Title: Global disaster losses from the EM-DAT database
Description: The International Disaster Database, EM-DAT
    (http://www.emdat.be/database) from the Center for Research on the
    Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED, Belgium) is often used as a reference for
    losses on human life and property resulting from natural and man-made
    disasters. This database has over 20,000 country-level records from the
    early 1900s to the present. This R package comes with cleaned EM-DAT data.
    Moreover, additional information on population and GDP, for each country in
    which a disaster occurred, is also provided. Functionality provided by this
    package includes extraction of desired subsets of data and also adjustment
    for inflation.
