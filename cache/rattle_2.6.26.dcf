Description: Rattle (the R Analytic Tool To Learn Easily) provides a
        Gnome (RGtk2) based interface to R functionality for data
        mining.  The aim is to provide a simple and intuitive interface
        that allows a user to quickly load data from a CSV file (or via
        ODBC), transform and explore the data, build and evaluate
        models, and export models as PMML (predictive modelling markup
        language) or as scores. All of this with knowing little about
        R. All R commands are logged and commented through the log tab.
        Thus they are available to the user as a script file or as an
        aide for the user to learn R or to copy-and-paste directly into
        R itself.  Rattle also exports a number of utility functions
        and the graphical user interface, invoked as rattle(), does not
        need to be run to deploy these.
