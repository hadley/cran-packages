Description: The iWebPlots package provides methods for the creation of
        interactive web-based scatter plots, generated directly via the
        R statistical environment. Interactivity is implemented using
        the fundamental HTML image map technology, so no additional
        software such as applets or plug-ins is required. Additional
        features include dynamic tooltips and text annotations as well
        as asynchronous alternation between two- and three-dimensional
        scatter plots.
