Description: A permutation test is used for inference in logistic
        regression.  The procedure is useful when parameter estimates
        in ordinary logistic regression fail to converge or are
        unreliable due to small sample size, or when the conditioning
        in exact conditional logistic regression restricts the sample
        space too severely.
