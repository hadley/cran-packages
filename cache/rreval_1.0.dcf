Description: rreval is a means for using R on a remote system from
        within a local R session.  Any R expression can be evaluated on
        the remote server. All non-graphical results are returned to
        the local R session: this includes the results of remote
        evaluations and (nearly) all textual output, including errors
        and warnings.  rreval uses socket level communication via ssh
        port forwarding. It supports uploading and downloading R
        objects and scp file tranfers.
