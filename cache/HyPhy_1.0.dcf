Description: A Bay Area high level phylogenetic analysis package mostly
        using the birth-death process. Analysis of species tree
        branching times and simulation of species trees under a number
        of different time variable birth-death processes.  Analysis of
        gene tree species tree reconciliations and simulations of gene
        trees in species trees.
