Description: A toolkit with infrastructure for representing,
  summarizing, and visualizing tree-structured regression and
  classification models. This unified infrastructure can be
  used for reading/coercing tree models from different sources
  (rpart, RWeka, PMML) yielding objects that share functionality for
  print/plot/predict methods. (It will also be the basis for
  a re-implementation of the party package. Currently, only
  a re-implementation of ctree() is contained in the package.)
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), graphics, stats, grid
Imports: survival, RWeka (>= 0.4-19)
Suggests: XML, pmml, mlbench, rJava, rpart, mvtnorm, Formula, TH.data
