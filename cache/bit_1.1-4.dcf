Description: bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs), coercion from and
        to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; fast boolean
        operators and fast summary statistics. With 'bit' vectors you
        can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the expense of 1
        bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less
        RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to
        overhead of R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of
        the vector: expect gains for vectors of size > 10000 elements.
        Even for one-time boolean operations it can pay-off to convert
        to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such components are used
        more than once. Reading from and writing to bit is
        approximately as fast as accessing standard logicals - mostly
        due to R's time for memory allocation. The package allows to
        work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling
        .Call() directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with
        pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to logical
        requires only 70% of the time for copying from logical to
        logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a performance
        penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for
        representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed
        selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked
        processing. All three index classes can be used for subsetting
        'ff' objects (ff-2.1-0 and higher).
