Description: This package implements generalized linear mixed model analysis of qRT-PCR data based on lognormal-Poisson model fitted using MCMC. Also implemented are the lognormal model for higher-abundance data and a "classic" model involving multi-gene normalization. Several plotting functions are included to extract and visualize results.
