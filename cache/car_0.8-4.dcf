	and Sanford Weisberg for various suggestions.

Depends: R (>= 1.3.0), modreg
Description: This package contains mostly functions for applied regession, linear models, and
  generalized linear models, with an emphasis on regression diagnostics, particularly 
  graphical diagnostic methods. There are also some utility functions. 
  With some exceptions, I have tried not to duplicate capabilities in the basic distribution of R, 
  nor in widely used packages. Some of the functions in car will use functions
  in the MASS package, if it is present; the plot.subsets function graphs
  objects produced by the regsubsets function in the leaps package. Where relevant, the functions in
  car are consistent with na.action = na.omit or na.exclude.
