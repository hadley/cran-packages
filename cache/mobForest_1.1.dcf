Description: This package implements random forest method for model
        based recursive partitioning. The mob() function, developed by
        Zeileis et al (2008), within party package, is modified to
        construct model-based decision trees based on random forests
        methodology. The main input function mobForestAnalysis() takes
        all input parameters to construct trees, compute out-of-bag
        errors, predictions, and overall accuracy of forest. The
        algorithm performs parallel computation using clusterApply()
        function within 'parallel' package.
