Description: Create and maintain delayed-data packages (ddp's).  Data
        stored in a ddp are available on demand, but do not take up
        memory until requested.  You attach a ddp with g.data.attach(),
        then read from it and assign to it in a manner similar to
        S-PLUS, except that you must run g.data.save() to actually
        commit to disk.
