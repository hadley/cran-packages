Description: NeatMap is a package to create heatmap like plots in 2 and
        3 dimensions, without the need for cluster analysis. Like the
        heatmap, the plots created by NeatMap display both a
        dimensionally reduced representation of the data as well as the
        data itself. They are intended to be used in conjunction with
        dimensional reduction techniques such as PCA.
