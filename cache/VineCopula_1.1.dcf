Description: This package provides functions for statistical inference
        of vine copulas. It contains tools for bivariate exploratory
        data analysis, bivariate copula selection and (vine) tree
        construction. Models can be estimated either sequentially or by
        joint maximum likelihood estimation. Sampling algorithms and
        plotting methods are also included. Data is assumed to lie in
        the unit hypercube (so-called copula data). For C- and D-vines
        links to the package CDVine are provided.
