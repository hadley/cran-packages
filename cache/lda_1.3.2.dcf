Description: This package implements latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
        and related models.  This includes (but is not limited to)
        sLDA, corrLDA, and the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel.
        Inference for all of these models is implemented via a fast
        collapsed Gibbs sampler writtten in C.  Utility functions for
        reading/writing data typically used in topic models, as well as
        tools for examining posterior distributions are also included.
