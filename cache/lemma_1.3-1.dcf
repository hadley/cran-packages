Title: Laplace approximated EM Microarray Analysis
Author: Haim Bar, Elizabeth Schifano.
Maintainer: Haim Bar <hyb2@cornell.edu>
Description: LEMMA is used to detect "nonnull genes" - genes for which
        the average response in treatment group 1 is significantly
        different from the average response in group 2, in normalized
        microarray data. LEMMA is an implementation of an approximate
        EM algorithm to estimate the parameters in the assumed linear
        model in Bar, Booth, Schifano, Wells (2009).
