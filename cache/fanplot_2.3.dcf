Description: The fanplot package contains a collection of R functions to effectively display plots of sequential distributions such as probabilistic forecasts. The plotting of distributions are based around two functions. The first, pn, calculates the percentiles for a set of sequential distributions over a specified time period. The second, fan, plots the calculated percentiles of the sequential distributions. The resulting plot is a set of coloured polygon, with shadings corresponding to the percentile values.
