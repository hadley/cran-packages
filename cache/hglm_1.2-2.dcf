Description: The hglm package is used to fit hierarchical generalized
        linear models. It can be used for linear mixed models and
        generalized linear mixed models with random effects for a
        variety of links and a variety of distributions for both the
        outcomes and the random effects. Fixed effects can also be
        fitted in the dispersion part of the mean model.
