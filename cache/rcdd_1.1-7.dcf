Title: rcdd (Computational Geometry)
Author: Charles J. Geyer <charlie@stat.umn.edu> and Glen D. Meeden
        <glen@stat.umn.edu>, incorporates code from cddlib (ver 0.94f)
        written by Komei Fukuda <fukuda@ifor.math.ethz.ch>
Maintainer: Charles J. Geyer <charlie@stat.umn.edu>
Depends: R (>= 2.6.0)
SystemRequirements: GMP (GNU MP bignum library from http://gmplib.org/)
Description: R interface to (some of) cddlib
        (http://www.ifor.math.ethz.ch/~fukuda/cdd_home/cdd.html).
        Converts back and forth between two representations of a convex
        polytope: as solution of a set of linear equalities and
        inequalities and as convex hull of set of points and rays.
        Also does linear programming and redundant generator
        elimination (for example, convex hull in n dimensions).  All
        functions can use exact infinite-precision rational arithmetic.
