Description: QCAGUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the QCA
        package, derived from R Commander.  Because QCA has little to
        do with statistics, the menus from Rcmdr were stripped down to
        the very basics.  In crisp sets QCA, data is binary therefore
        it is fairly decent to treat it as categorical (1 - presence; 0
        - absence).  In order to ease the primary analysis (e.g. tables
        of frequencies) and the creation of basic graphs, this package
        activates some menus that are not available in Rcmdr but for
        factors. Users should be aware, however, that QCAGUI is not a
        package for statistics; Rcmdr is better suited for this
        purpose.
