Description: This package is intended to perform estimation and
        prediction in high-dimensional additive models, using a sparse
        PAC-Bayesian point of view and a MCMC algorithm. The method is
        fully described in Guedj and Alquier (2013), 'PAC-Bayesian
        Estimation and Prediction in Sparse Additive Models',
        Electronic Journal of Statistics, 7, 264--291.
