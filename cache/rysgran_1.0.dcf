Description: This package is a port to R of the SysGran program,
        written in Delphi by Camargo (2006). It contains functions for
        the analysis of grain size samples (only in phi scale in this
        version) based on various methods, like Folk & Ward (1957) and
        Methods of Moments (Tanner, 1995), among others; textural
        classifications and distribuition of uncosolidated sediments
        are shown in histograms, bivariated plots and ternary diagrams
        of Shepard (1954) and Pejrup (1988). English and portuguese
        languages are supported in outputs.
