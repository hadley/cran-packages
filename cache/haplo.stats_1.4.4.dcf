Title: Statistical Analysis of Haplotypes with Traits and Covariates
        when Linkage Phase is Ambiguous
Author: Sinnwell JP, Schaid DJ
Maintainer: Jason P. Sinnwell <sinnwell.jason@mayo.edu>
Description: A suite of S-PLUS/R routines for the analysis of
        indirectly measured haplotypes. The statistical methods assume
        that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are
        ambiguous (due to unknown linkage phase of the genetic
        markers). The main functions are: haplo.em, haplo.glm,
        haplo.score, haplo.power, and seqhap. Copyright: 2003 Mayo
