Description: Routines to handle family data with a pedigree object. The
        initial purpose was to create correlation structures that
        describe family relationships such as kinship and
        identity-by-descent, which can be used to model family data in
        mixed effects models, such as in the coxme function.  Also
        includes a tool for pedigree drawing which is focused on
        producing compact layouts without intervention.  Recent
        additions include utilities to trim the pedigree object with
        various criteria.
