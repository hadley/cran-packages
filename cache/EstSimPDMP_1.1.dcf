Description: This package deals with the estimation of the jump rate
        for piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), from only
        one observation of the process within a long time. The main
        functions provide an estimate of this function. The state space
        may be discrete or continuous. The associated paper is given in
        References. Other functions provide a method to simulate random
        variables from their (conditional) hazard rate, and then to
        simulate PDMPs.
