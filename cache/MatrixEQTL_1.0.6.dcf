Description: Matrix eQTL is designed for fast eQTL analysis on large
        datasets. Matrix eQTL can test for association between genotype
        and gene expression using both linear regression and ANOVA
        models. The models can include covariates to account for such
        factors as population structure, gender, and clinical
        variables. It also supports models with heteroscedastic and/or
        correlated errors.
