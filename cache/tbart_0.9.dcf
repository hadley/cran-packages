Description: Solves Teitz and Bart's p-median problem - given a set of
        points attempts to find subset of size p such that summed
        distances of any point in the set to the nearest point in p is
        minimised.  Although generally effective, this algorithm does
        not guarantee that a globally optimal subset is found.
