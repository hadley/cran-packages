Description: The package contains methods to support frontier analysis.
        It covers Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). DEA is supported
        under different technology assumptions (fdh, vrs, drs, crs,
        irs, add/frh, and fdh+), and using different efficiency
        measures (input based, output based, hyperbolic graph,
        additive, super, and directional efficency). Peers and slacks
        are available, partial price information can be included, and
        optimal cost, revenue and profit can be calculated. Evaluation
        of mergers is also supported.  Methods for graphing the
        technology sets are also included. The package also support
        comparative methods based on Stochastic Frontier Analyses
        (SFA). In general, the methods can be used to solve not only
        standard models, but also many other model variants. The
        package complements the book, Bogetoft and Otto, Benchmarking
        with DEA, SFA, and R, Springer-Verlag, 2011, but can of course
        also be used as a stand-alone package.
