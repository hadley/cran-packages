Title: Wrapper for fftw3: includes 1-D, univariate and multivariate,
        and 2-D transform

Suggests: fftw
Description: This package is a wrapper for several fftw functions.
        Please see the fftw package for additional tools. This package
        provides access to the two-dimensional fft, the multivariate
        fft, and the one-dimensional real to complex fft using fftw3.
        The package includes the functions fftw and mvfftw which are
        designed to mimic the functionality of the R functions fftw and
        mvfft. The fft functions have a parameter that allows them to
        not return the redundant complex conjugate when the input is
        real data. Please see the package fftw for general
        one-dimensional use of fftw, the discrete cosine transform, and
        for more detailed use of performance enhancing plans when using
        fftw. The calls to fftw and mvfftw in this package mimic the
        standard routines in R.
