Description: Cross-validated linear discriminant calculations
  determine the optimum number of features. Test and training
  scores from successive cross-validation steps determine, via a
  principal components calculation, a low-dimensional global space onto
  which test scores are projected, in order to plot them. Further functions
  are included for didactic purposes.
