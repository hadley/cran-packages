Description: catmap is an R package that conducts fixed-effects (inverse variance) and random-effects (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986) meta-analyses of case-control or family-based (TDT) genetic data; in addition, it performs meta-analyses combining these two types of study designs.  The fixed-effects model was first described by Kazeem and Farrell (2005); the random-effects model is described in Nicodemus (submitted).}
