Description: How much ram do you need to store a 100,000 by 100,000 matrix?
  Learn the scintillating answer to this and many more such questions with
  the memuse package.  This package gives the user the size (memory usage) 
  of an unallocated, in-core, dense, numeric matrix.  The output is an S4 
  class object that can be manipulated to be presented in different ways 
  (different units, short/long versions of those units, etc.).  The package
  offers similar functionality to that of R's object.size() function, with 
  the key difference being that memuse does not require an object to already
  be allocated.  So one can determine the size of enormous matrices even
  from a laptop.
