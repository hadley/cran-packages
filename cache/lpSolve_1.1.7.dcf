Author: Michel Berkelaar and others
Maintainer: Sam Buttrey <buttrey@nps.navy.mil>
Description: Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for
    solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this implementation
    we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R functions that solve
    general linear/integer problems, assignment problems, and transportation
    problems. This version calls lp_solve version 5.
