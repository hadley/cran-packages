Description: A tableplot is a visualisation of a (large) statistical
        dataset with a dozen of variables, both both numeric and
        categorical. Each column represents a variable and each row bin
        is an aggregate of a certain number of records. Numeric
        variables are visualized as bar charts, and categorical
        variables as stacked bar charts. Missing values are taken into
        account. A GUI has been implemented which is used to easily
        customize the tableplot. Also supports large ffdf datasets from
        the ff package.
