Description: Construct and plot objective hierarchies and associated
        value and utility functions.  Evaluate the values and utilities
        and visualize the results as colored objective hierarchies or
        tables.  Visualize uncertainty by plotting median and quantile
        intervals within the nodes of objective hierarchies.  Get
        numerical results of the evaluations in standard R data tyes
        for further processing.
