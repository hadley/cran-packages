Description: Translates a CSS3 selector into an equivalent XPath
        expression. This allows us to use CSS selectors when working
        with the XML package as it can only evaluate XPath expressions.
        Also provided are convenience functions useful for using CSS
        selectors on XML nodes. This package is a port of the Python
        package "cssselect" (http://packages.python.org/cssselect/).
