Description: Automated model selection and model-averaging. Provides a
        wrapper for glm and similar functions, automatically generating
        all possible models (under constraints set by the user) with
        the specified response and explanatory variables, and finding
        the best models in terms of some Information Criterion (AIC,
        AICc or BIC). Can handle very large numbers of candidate
        models. Features a Genetic Algorithm to find the best models
        when an exhaustive screening of the candidates is not feasible.
