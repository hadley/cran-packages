Description: TDM can be used to estimate individual pharmacokinetic 
             parameters with one or more drug serum/plasma concentra-
             tions obtained from a single subject or multiple subjects
             using OpenBUGS (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling)
             interfaced through BRugs. Besides, it also can calculate
             a suggested dose with the target drug concentration (C ->D)
             or calculate a predicted drug concentration with a given 
             dose (D -> C).
