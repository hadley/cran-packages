Description: Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit
        (signed) integers that can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays
        and data.frames. Methods are available for coercion from and to
        logicals, integers, doubles, characters as well as many
        elementwise and summary functions.  With 'integer64' vectors
        you can store very large integers at the expense of 64 bits,
        which is by factor 7 better than 'int64' from package 'int64'.
        Due to the smaller memory footprint, the atomic vector
        architecture and using only S3 instead of S4 classes, most
        operations are one to three orders of magnitude faster: Example
        speedups are 4x for serialization, 250x for adding, 900x for
        coercion and 2000x for object creation. Also 'integer64' avoids
        an ongoing (potentially infinite) penalty for garbage
        collection observed during existence of 'int64' objects (see
        code in example section).  Last but not least, this package has
        no commercial copyright attached, it is not sponsored by any
        commercial company or otherwise influenced by commercial
        interests. Its mix of high-level R code with low-level C-code
        protects against misuse outside the GPLed R context.
