Description: GrapheR is a multiplatform user interface for drawing
        highly customizable graphs in R. It aims to be a valuable help
        to quickly draw publishable graphs without any knowledge of R
        commands. Six kinds of graphs are available: histogram,
        box-and-whisker plot, bar plot, pie chart, curve and scatter
        plot.
