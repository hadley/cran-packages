Description: This package accompanies J. Fox, An R and S-PLUS Companion
        to Applied Regression, Sage, 2002. The package contains mostly
        functions for applied regression, linear models, and
        generalized linear models, with an emphasis on regression
        diagnostics, particularly graphical diagnostic methods. There
        are also some utility functions. With some exceptions, I have
        tried not to duplicate capabilities in the basic distribution
        of R, nor in widely used packages. Where relevant, the
        functions in car are consistent with na.action = na.omit or
        na.exclude.
