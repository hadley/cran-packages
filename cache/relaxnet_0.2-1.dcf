Title: Relaxation of glmnet models (as in relaxed lasso, Meinshausen
        2007)
Version: 0.2-1
Date: 2013-05-13
Author: Stephan Ritter, Alan Hubbard
Maintainer: Stephan Ritter <sritter@berkeley.edu>
Depends: glmnet
Description: Extends the glmnet package with "relaxation", done by
        running glmnet once on the entire predictor matrix, then again
        on each different subset of variables from along the
        regularization path. Penalty may be lasso (alpha = 1) or
        elastic net (0 < alpha < 1). For this version, family may be
        "gaussian" or "binomial" only. Takes advantage of fast fortran
        code from the glmnet package.
