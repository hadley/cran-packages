        methods which are typically used for the estimation of
        outstanding claims reserves in general insurance. The package
        has implementations of the Mack-, Munich-, Bootstrap, and
        multi-variate chain-ladder methods, as well as the loss
        development factor curve fitting methods of Dave Clark and
        generalised linear model based reserving models.
