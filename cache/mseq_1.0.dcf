Description: This package implements all the methods in the paper
        "Modeling non-uniformity in short-read rates in RNA-Seq data".
        Especially, it implements both the iterative glm procedure for
        the Poisson linear model and the training procedure of the MART
        model. The cross-validation for both of the methods is also
        implemented.
