Description: By combining constant, linear, and quadratic local models,
        lazy estimates the value of an unknown multivariate function on
        the basis of a set of possibly noisy samples of the function
        itself.  This implementation of lazy learning automatically
        adjusts the bandwidth on a query-by-query basis through a
        leave-one-out cross-validation.
