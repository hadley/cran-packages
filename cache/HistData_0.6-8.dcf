Description: The HistData package provides a collection of small data
        sets that are interesting and important in the history of
        statistics and data visualization. The goal of the package is
        to make these available, both for instructional use and for
        historical research.  Some of these present interesting
        challenges for graphics or analysis in R.
Suggests: gtools, KernSmooth, maps, ggplot2, proto, grid, reshape,
