Description: scaRabee is a port of the Scarabee toolkit originally
        written as a Matlab-based application. It provides a framework
        for simulation and optimization of
        pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models at the individual and
        population level. It is built on top of the neldermead package,
        which provides the direct search algorithm proposed by Nelder
        and Mead for model optimization.
