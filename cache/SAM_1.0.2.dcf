Description: The package SAM targets at high dimensional classification
        problem for complex data analysis. SAM is short for sparse
        additive machine, which is a explicit combination of high
        dimensional sparse additive modeling and support vector
        machine. Different from existing non-linear classification
        methods, which usually use, SAM adopts the computationally
        efficient basis spline technique. The optimization is solved by
        the Linearized Alternative Direction Method of Multipliers
        (L-ADMM). The computation is further accelerated by warm-start
        and active-set tricks. For users who are interested in
        large-scale problems, we also provide an implementation of L1
        norm SVM for computational convenience.
