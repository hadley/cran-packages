Description: This package uses item response theory methods to compute
        linking constants and conduct chain linking of unidimensional
        or multidimensional tests for multiple groups under a common
        item design.  The unidimensional methods include the Mean/Mean,
        Mean/Sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord methods for dichotomous
        (1PL, 2PL and 3PL) and/or polytomous (graded response, partial
        credit/generalized partial credit, nominal, and multiple-choice
        model) items.  The multidimensional methods include the
        Reckase-Martineau method and extensions of the Haebara and
        Stocking-Lord method using a single dilation parameter,
        multiple dilation parameters, or the Oshima, Davey, & Lee
        approach for multidimensional extensions of all the
        unidimensional dichotomous and polytomous item response models.
        The package also includes functions for importing item and/or
        ability parameters from common IRT software and ploting item
        characteristic/category curves or surfaces, vector plots, and
        comparison plots for examining parameter drift.
