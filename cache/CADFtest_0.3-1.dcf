Description: This package performs Hansen's (1995) Covariate-Augmented
        Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test. The only required argument is y, the
        Tx1 time series to be tested. If no stationary covariate X is
        passed to the procedure, then an ordinary ADF test is
        performed. The p-values of the test are computed using a
        procedure proposed in Costantini, Lupi and Popp (2007),
        illustrated in Lupi (2009).
