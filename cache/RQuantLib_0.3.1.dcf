Description: The RQuantLib package makes parts of QuantLib visible to
        the R user. Currently a number option pricing functions are
        included, both vanilla and exotic, as well as a broad range of
        fixed-income functions, as well a general utilities such as
        business day calendar computations. Further software
        contributions are welcome.
 .
 The QuantLib project aims to provide a comprehensive software framework
        for quantitative finance. The goal is to provide a standard
        open source library for quantitative analysis, modeling,
        trading, and risk management of financial assets.
 .
 The Windows binary version is self-contained and does not require a
        QuantLib (or Boost) installation.
 .
 RQuantLib uses the Rcpp R/C++ interface class library. See the Rcpp
        package on CRAN (or R-Forge) for more information on Rcpp.
 .
 Note that while RQuantLib's code is licensed under the GPL (v2 or
        later), QuantLib itself is released under a somewhat less
        restrictive Open Source license (see QuantLib-License.txt).
