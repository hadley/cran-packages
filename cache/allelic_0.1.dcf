Description: This is the implementation in R+C of a new association
        test described in "A fast, unbiased and exact allelic exact
        test for case-control association studies" (Submitted).  It
        appears that in most cases the classical chi-square test used
        for testing for allelic association on genotype data is biased.
        Our test is unbiased, exact but fast throught careful
        optimization.
