Description: Due to lack of proper inference procedure and software, the ordinary linear regression model is seldom used in practice for the analysis of right censored data. This paper presents an S-Plus/R program that implements a recently developed inference procedure (Jin, Lin and Ying, 2006)\cite{Jin} for the accelerated failure time model based on the least-squares principle.
