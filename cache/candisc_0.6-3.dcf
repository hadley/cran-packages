Description: This package includes functions for computing and
        visualizing generalized canonical discriminant analyses and
        canonical correlation analysis for a multivariate linear model.
        Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a
        one-way MANOVA design and is equivalent to canonical
        correlation analysis between a set of quantitative response
        variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor
        variable.  The candisc package generalizes this to multi-way
        MANOVA designs for all factors in a multivariate linear model,
        computing canonical scores and vectors for each term. The
        graphic functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) visualizations
        of terms in an mlm via the plot.candisc and heplot.candisc
        methods. Related plots are now provided for canonical
        correlation analysis when all predictors are quantitative.
