Author: Heather Turner and David Firth
Description: Functions to specify and fit generalized nonlinear models,
        including models with multiplicative interaction terms such as
        the UNIDIFF model from sociology and the AMMI model from crop
        science, and many others.  Over-parameterized representations
        of models are used throughout; functions are provided for
        inference on estimable parameter combinations, as well as
        standard methods for diagnostics etc.
