Title: Routines for fitting kinetic models to chemical degradation data
Version: 1.1.04
Date: 2011-09-01
Author: Johannes Ranke and Katrin Lindenberger

Description: Simple calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics
        Report (2006). Only kinetic models for parent only datasets are
        included (no metabolite formation/decline or multicompartment
        kinetics). Please note that no warranty is implied for
        correctness of results or fitness for a particular purpose.
