Description: E-statistics (energy) tests for comparing distributions: multivariate normality, multivariate k-sample test for equal distributions, hierarchical clustering by e-distances, multivariate independence test, Poisson test. Energy-statistics concept based on a generalization of Newton's potential energy is due to Gabor J. Szekely.
