Description: For a given phylogeny on present day data which is
        calibrated to calendar-time, a method for estimating maximum
        likelihood speciation and extinction processes is provided. The
        method accounts for rate changes and mass extinction events:
        Time is split into intervals. Throughout an interval, the
        speciation and extinction rates stay constant. At the end of an
        interval, the speciation and extinction rates may change, and a
        fraction of the extant species may become extinct (mass
        extinction). No species becoming extinct at the end of an
        interval is a rate shift event without mass extinction. The
        method estimates the maximum likelihood time intervals, the
        speciation and extinction rates in each interval, and the
        fraction of species going extinct (unless the fraction is known
        and set to a predefined value). Note that the method takes into
        account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the
        "pull of the present" effect.
