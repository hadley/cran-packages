Description: cloudRmpi is means for doing parallel processing in R,
        using MPI on a cloud-based network.  It currently supports the
        use of Amazon's EC2 cloud computer service. cloudRmpi provides
        a mechanism to launch and manage a cloud-based network and to
        access an R session on the network's master MPI node (using the
        rreval package). cloudRmpi should work with any MPI based R
        package (it has been tested with Rmpi, npRmpi, and snow).
