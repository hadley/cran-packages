Title: Visualizes the scoring and binning of microsatellite fragment
        sizes
Version: 1.05
Date: 2013-11-14
Author: Filipe Alberto
Maintainer: Filipe Alberto <albertof@uwm.edu>
Description: The package contains functions to: 1) load ah files from Strand software and build a R data 
	base; 2) plot different graphical displays of the fragment sizes obtained for each locus and their bins; 3) 
	interact with graphs to sort the data base for a given locus and range, allowing to easily  trace back a 
	particular group of samples to its original Strand file; bin fragment size data into population genetics files.
	4) From version 1.04 on, the user can set manually bin limits and write files combining the manual and 
	automatic methods to bin alleles.
