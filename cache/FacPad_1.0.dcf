Description: This method tries to explain the gene-wise treatment
        response ratios in terms of the latent pathways. It uses
        bayesian sparse factor modeling to infer the loadings (weights)
        of each pathway on its associated probesets as well as the
        latent factor activity levels for each treatment.
