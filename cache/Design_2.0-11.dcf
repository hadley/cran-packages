Description: Regression modeling, testing, estimation, validation,
	graphics, prediction, and typesetting by storing enhanced model design
	attributes in the fit.  Design is a collection of about 180 functions
	that assist and streamline modeling, especially for biostatistical and
	epidemiologic applications.  It also contains new functions for binary
	and ordinal logistic regression models and the Buckley-James multiple
	regression model for right-censored responses, and implements
	penalized maximum likelihood estimation for logistic and ordinary
	linear models.  Design works with almost any regression model, but it
	was especially written to work with logistic regression, Cox
	regression, accelerated failure time models, ordinary linear models,
	the Buckley-James model, and generalized least squares for
	serially or spatially correlated observations.
