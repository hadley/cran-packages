Title: Interface utilities for JAGS (using BUGS syntax) and Apple Xgrid
        distributed computing clusters
Author: Matthew Denwood <matthew.denwood@glasgow.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Matthew Denwood <matthew.denwood@glasgow.ac.uk>
Depends: R (>= 2.13), coda, lattice, stats, utils

SystemRequirements: jags (see http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net)
Description: A set of utility functions to run BUGS models using JAGS
        from within R, and for JAGS or arbitrary R code submission to
        Xgrid clusters (requires Mac OS X).  Automatic control of model
        run length, calculation of autocorrealtion and Gelman Rubin
        statistic diagnostics, generation of trace and density plots,
        calculation of DIC, and automatic retrieval of R objects as
        data are supported.  Utilities to run user-supplied R functions
        on Xgrid (using xapply as a replacement for lapply) are also
        included, and do not require JAGS.
