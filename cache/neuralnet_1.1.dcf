Description: Training of neural networks using the Resilient Backpropagation with (Riedmiller, 1994) or without Weightbacktracking (Riedmiller, 1993) or the modified globally convergent version by Anastasiadis et. al. (2005). The package allows flexible settings through custom-choice of error- and activation-function. Furthermore the calculation of generalized weights (Intrator O & Intrator N, 1993) is implemented.
