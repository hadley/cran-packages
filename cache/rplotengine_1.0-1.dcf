Description: This package is intended for using R as a plotting engine
        either by custom applications, or from a small script launched
        from the system console, or even within the R console. Two
        ASCII text files are necessary: (1) The graph parameters file,
        which name is passed to the function 'rplotengine()'.  The user
        can specify the titles, choose the type of the graph, graph
        output formats (e.g. png, eps), proportion of the X-axis and
        Y-axis, position of the legend, whether to show or not a grid
        at the background, etc.  (2) The data to be plotted, which name
        is specified as a parameter ('data_filename') in the previous
        file. This data file has a tabulated format, with a single
        character (e.g. tab) between each column, and a headers line
        located in the first row.  Optionally, the file could include
        data columns for showing confidence intervals.
