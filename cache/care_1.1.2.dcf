Description: The "care" package implements the regression approach of
        Zuber and Strimmer (2011) "High-dimensional regression and
        variable selection using CAR scores" SAGMB 10: 34.  CAR scores
        measure the correlation between the response and the
        Mahalanobis-decorrelated predictors.  The squared CAR score is
        a natural measure of variable importance and provides a
        canonical ordering of variables. This package provides
        functions for estimating CAR scores, for variable selection
        using CAR scores, and for estimating corresponding regression
        coefficients. Both shrinkage as well as empirical estimators
        are available.
