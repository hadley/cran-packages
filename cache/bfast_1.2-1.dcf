Description: BFAST integrates the decomposition of time series into
        trend, seasonal, and remainder components with methods for
        detecting and characterizing abrupt changes within the trend
        and seasonal components. BFAST can be used to analyze different
        types of satellite image time series and can be applied to
        other disciplines dealing with seasonal or non-seasonal time
        series, such as hydrology, climatology, and econometrics. The
        algorithm can be extended to label detected changes with
        information on the parameters of the fitted piecewise linear
        models.
