Description: Comprehensive implementation of Dynamic Time Warping
 algorithms in R. DTW finds the optimal (least cumulative distance)
 mapping between two time series. This package implements all common
 DTW variants, including local and global constraints, arbitrary
 timeseries lenghts, distance definitions, etc.  Methods provides
 cumulative distance, warping functions, plots, etc.
