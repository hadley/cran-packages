Description: Circular genomic permutation approach uses GWAS results to
        establish the significance of pathway/gene-set associations
        whilst accounting for genomic structure. All SNPs in the GWAS
        are placed in a 'circular genome' according to their location.
        Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted
        by rotation with respect to the SNPs' genomic locations
