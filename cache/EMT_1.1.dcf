Description: The package provides functions to carry out a
        Goodness-of-fit test for discrete multivariate data. It is
        tested if a given observation is likely to have occurred under
        the assumption of an ab-initio model. A p-value can be
        calculated using different distance measures between observed
        and expected frequencies. A Monte Carlo method is provided to
        make the package capable of solving high-dimensional problems.
