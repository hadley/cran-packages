Description: This package provides the function 'lsmeans' for
        outputting so-called least-squares means for factor
        combinations in an 'lm', 'lme', or 'lmer' object. It can also
        compute contrasts or linear combinations of these least-squares
        means, and several standard contrast families are provided.
