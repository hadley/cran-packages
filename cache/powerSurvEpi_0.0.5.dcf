Description: This package includes a set of functions to calculate
        power and sample size for testing main effect or interaction
        effect in the survival analysis of epidemiological studies
        (non-randomized studies), taking into account the correlation
        between the covariate of the interest and other covariates.
        Some calculations also take into account the competing risks.
        This package also includes a set of functions to calculate
        power and sample size for testing main effect in the survival
        analysis of randomized clinical trials.
