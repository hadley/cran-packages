Description: The Rknots package contains functions for the topological
        analysis of polymeric structures, either biological polymers or
        synthetic structures, with a major focus on proteins. This
        release provides a Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries import
        function, two structure reduction algorithms (MSR, Minimal
        Structure Reduction and Alexander-Briggs reduction),
        polynomials (Alexander, Jones and HOMFLY polynomial via
        Conway's skein triple) and linking number computation,
        graphical functions and a set of utilities. Credits are due to
        the bio3d package on which the PDB import function is based, to
        the google code project SymPy that provides a Computer Algebra
        System for Python and to the Rsympy package.
