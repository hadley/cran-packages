Description: This package contains diverse more or less complicated
        functions, written to simplify beginners' (but not only) life:
        simplifications of existing functions, basic but not
        implemented tests, easy-to-use tools, bridges between functions
        of different packages... All functions are presented in the
        French book 'Aide-memoire de statistique appliquee a la
        biologie', written by the same author and available on CRAN.
