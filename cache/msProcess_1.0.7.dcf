Description: This package provides tools for protein mass spectra
        processing including data preparation, denoising, noise
        estimation, baseline correction, intensity normalization, peak
        detection, peak alignment, peak quantification, and various
        functionalities for data ingestion/conversion, mass
        calibration, data quality assessment, and protein mass spectra
        simulation. It also provides auxiliary tools for data
        representation, data visualization, and pipeline processing
        history recording and retrieval.
