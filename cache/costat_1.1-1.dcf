Title: Time series costationarity determination and tests of
        stationarity.

Description: Contains functions that can determine whether a time
        series is second-order stationary or not (and hence evidence
        for locally stationarity). Given two non-stationary series
        (i.e. locally stationary series) this package can then discover
        time-varying linear combinations that are second-order
        stationary.
