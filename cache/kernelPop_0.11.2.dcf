Description: This package creates a individual-based population genetic
        simulation.  Individuals have spatial coordiantes, dispersal
        governed by mixtures of Weibull and normal pdfs.  It is
        discrete-time.  It can be arbitrarily complex given enough
        known or assumed demographic characteristics.  Simulates
        diploid and haploid inheritance. Allows the development of null
        distributions of genotypes for complex demographic scenarios.
        This version includes some approximations for pollen (male
        gamete) dispersal.
