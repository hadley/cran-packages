Description: A suite of routines that can be used to compute score
  statistics to test associations between haplotypes and a wide
  variety of traits, including binary, ordinal, quantitative, and
  Poisson. These methods assume that all subjects are unrelated and
  that haplotypes are ambiguous (due to unknown linkage phase of the
  genetic markers). The methods provide several different global and
  haplotype-specific tests for association, as well as provide
  adjustment for non-genetic covariates and computation of simulation
  p-values (which may be needed for sparse data). Details on the
  background and theory of the score statistics can be found in the
