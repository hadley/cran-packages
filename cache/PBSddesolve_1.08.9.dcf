Description: This package solves systems of delay differential
        equations. by interfacing numerical routines written by Simon
        N. Wood <s.wood _at_ bath.ac.uk>, with contributions by
        Benjamin J. Cairns <ben.cairns@bristol.ac.uk>. These numerical
        routines first appeared in Simon Wood's solv95 program. This
        package includes a vignette and a complete user's guide.
        'PBSddesolve' originally appeared on CRAN under the name
        'ddesolve'. That version is no longer supported. The current
        name emphasizes a close association with other PBS packages,
        particularly 'PBSmodelling'.
