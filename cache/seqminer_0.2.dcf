Description: Integrate sequencing data (VCF) or meta-analysis results
        in R
Copyright: We have used the following software and made minimal
        necessary changes: Zlib, Jean-loup Gailly <jloup@gzip.org> and
        Mark Adler <madler@alumni.caltech.edu> (License:
        http://zlib.net/zlib_license.html). We have changed its source
        code to not include stdio.h, and explicitly includes unistd.h
        heade file; Bzip2, Julian Seward <jseward@bzip.org> (BSD
        license). We have renamed compress.c to bzCompress.c to avoid
        name collision with zlib.h, and its license files are renamed
        to bzip2.README and bzip2.LICENSE; Tabix, Heng Li
        <lh3@live.co.uk> (MIT license). We removed standard IO related
        functions, e.g. printf, fprintf ; also changed its un-safe
        pointer arithmetics.
