Title: Tools for extracting dendrogram and tree diagram plot data for
        use with ggplot.
LazyData: true
LazyLoad: true
Description: This is a set of tools for dendrograms and tree plots
        using ggplot.  The ggplot philosophy is to clearly separate
        data from the presentation.  Unfortunately the plot method for
        dendrograms plots directly to a plot device without exposing
        the data.  The ggdendro package resolves this by making
        available functions that extract the dendrogram plot data.
