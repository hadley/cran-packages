Title: Non-Negative Sparse PCA
Description: This package implements two methods for performing a
        principal component analysis (PCA) with constraints, where
        non-negativity and/or sparsity constraints are enforced on the
        principal axes (PAs).  The function 'nsprcomp' computes one
        principal component (PC) after the other. Each PA is optimized
        such that the corresponding PC has maximum variance under the
        given constraints. Then the data matrix is deflated using one
        of several deflation methods, and the process is repeated with
        the deflated data matrix to compute the next PC.  In contrast,
        the function 'nscumcomp' jointly computes all PCs such that the
        cumulative variance is maximal, subject to an upper bound on
        the divergence from orthonormality of the rotation matrix.
        Both functions have the same interface as the 'prcomp' function
        from the 'stats' package (plus some extra parameters), and both
        return the result of the analysis as an object of class
        'nsprcomp', which inherits from 'prcomp'.
