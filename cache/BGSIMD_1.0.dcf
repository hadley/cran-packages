Description: Implement an efficient block Gibbs sampler with incomplete
        data from a multinomial distribution taking values from the k
        categories 1,2,...,k, where data are assumed to miss at random
        and each missing datum belongs to one and only one of m
        distinct non-empty proper subsets A1, A2,..., Am of 1,2,...,k
        and the k categories are labelled such that only consecutive
        A's may overlap.
