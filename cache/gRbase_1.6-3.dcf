Description: The gRbase package provides certain general constructs
        which are used by other graphical modelling packages, in
        particular by the packages gRain, gRim and gRc.
 .
 gRbase contains several datasets relevant for use in connection with
        graphical models. Almost all datasets used in the book
        Graphical Models with R (2012) are contained in gRbase.
 .
 gRbase implements several graph algorithms (based mainly on
        representing graphs as adjacency matrices - either in the form
        of a standard matrix or a sparse matrix). Some graph algorithms
        are: * maximum cardinality search (for marked and unmarked
        graphs).  * moralize * triangulate * junctionTree
 .
 gRbase facilities for array operations,
 .
 gRbase implements functions for testing for conditional independence.
 .
 gRbase illustrates how hierarchical log-linear models (hllm) may be
        implemented and describes concept of gmData (graphical meta
        data). These features, however, are not maintained anymore and
        remains in gRbase only because there exists a paper describing
        these facilities: A Common Platform for Graphical Models in R:
        The gRbase Package, Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 14, No
        17, 2005.
