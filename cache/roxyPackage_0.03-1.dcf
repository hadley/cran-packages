Description: The intention of this package is to make packaging R code
        as easy as possible. roxyPackage uses tools from the roxygen2
        package to generate documentation. It also automatically
        generates and updates files like *-package.R, DESCRIPTION,
        CITATION, ChangeLog and NEWS.Rd. Building packages supports
        source format, as well as several binary formats (MS Windows,
        Mac OS X, Debian GNU/Linux) if the package contains pure R code
        only. The packages built are stored in a fully functional local
        R package repository which can be synced to a web server to
        share them with others.  This includes the generation of
        browsable HTML pages similar to CRAN, with support for RSS
        feeds from the ChangeLog. Please read the vignette for a more
        detailed explanation by example.
