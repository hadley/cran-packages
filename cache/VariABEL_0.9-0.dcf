        potentially interacting SNP.

Description: Presence of interaction between a SNP and another SNP (or another factor) can result 
	in heterogeneity of variance between the genotypes of an interacting SNP. 
	Detecting such heterogeneity gives prior knowledge for constructing a genetic model 
	underlying complex trait.
