Title: Fisher-Wright Population Simulation
Author: Mikkel Meyer Andersen and Poul Svante Eriksen
Maintainer: Mikkel Meyer Andersen <mikl@math.aau.dk>
Depends: R (>= 1.8.0)
Description: Simulates a population under the Fisher-Wright model with
        a stepwise neutral mutation process. The population sizes are
        random Poisson distributed and different kinds of population
        growth are supported. It is possible to specify locus and
        direction (in terms of upwards and downwards mutation rate)
        specific mutation rate.
