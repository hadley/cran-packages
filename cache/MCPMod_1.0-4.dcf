Description: This package implements a methodology for the design and
        analysis of dose-response studies that combines aspects of
        multiple comparison procedures and modeling approaches (Bretz,
        Pinheiro and Branson, 2005, Biometrics 61, 738-748). The
        package provides tools for the analysis of dose finding trials
        as well as a variety of tools necessary to plan a trial to be
        conducted with the MCPMod methodology.
