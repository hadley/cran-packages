Description: A package providing methods for cubature (numerical
        integration) over polygonal domains.  Currently, three
        (non-adaptive) cubature methods are implemented: the
        two-dimensional midpoint rule (a simple wrapper around
        spatstat::as.im.function), the product Gauss cubature proposed
        by Sommariva and Vianello (2007), and a quasi-exact method
        specific to the integration of the bivariate Gaussian density
        over polygonal domains.  For cubature over simple hypercubes,
        the packages "cubature" and "R2cuba" are more appropriate.
