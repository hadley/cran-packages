Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications The RInside
        packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your C++
        application by providing a few wrapper classes.
 .
 As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build
        of R is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows
        provided you use the same tools used to build R itself.
 .
 Several examples are provided in the examples/ directory of the
        installed package, and Doxygen-generated documentation of the
        C++ classes is included as well.
Depends: R (>= 2.8.0), Rcpp (>= 0.6.7)
