Description: Testing SNPs and SNP interactions with a genotypic TDT.
        This package furthermore contains functions for computing
        pairwise values of LD measures and for identifying LD blocks,
        as well as functions for setting up matched case pseudo-control
        genotype data for case-parent trios in order to run trio logic
        regression, for imputing missing genotypes in trios, for
        simulating case-parent trios with disease risk dependent on SNP
        interaction, and for power and sample size calculation in trio
        data.
