Description: Cross-validated linear discriminant calculations determine
        the optimum number of features. Test and training scores from
        successive cross-validation steps determine, via a principal
        components calculation, a low-dimensional global space onto
        which test scores are projected, in order to plot them. Further
        functions are included that serve didactic purposes.
