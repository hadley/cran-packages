Description: The FisherEM package provides an efficient algorithm for
        the unsupervised classification of high-dimensional data. This
        FisherEM algorithm models and clusters the data in a
        discriminative and low-dimensional latent subspace. It also
        provides a low-dimensional representation of the clustered
        data. A sparse version of Fisher-EM algorithm is also provided.
