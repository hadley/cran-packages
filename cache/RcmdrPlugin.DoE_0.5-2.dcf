Description: WARNING: This package is currently in beta status! The
        package provides a platform-independent GUI for design of
        experiments. It is implemented as a plugin to the R-Commander,
        which is a more general graphical user interface for statistics
        in R based on tcl/tk. DoE functionality can be accessed through
        the menu Design that is added to the R-Commander menus.
