Description: A package to support open source development using UML and
        R. Model specification is programmatic, however a simple GUI
        can be used for layout. There's a strong emphasis on producing
        static vector graphics (suitable for pdflatex). This package is
        incomplete and experimental. Currently, inheritance diagrams
        only.
