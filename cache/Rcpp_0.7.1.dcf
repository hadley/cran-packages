Description: R/C++ interface classes and examples The Rcpp library maps
        data types betweeen R and C++, and includes support for R types
        real, integer, character, vector, matrix, Date, datetime (i.e.
        POSIXct) at microsecond resolution, data frame, and function.
        Transer to and from simple SEXP objects is particular easy.
        Calling R functions from C++ is also supported.
 .
 C++ code can be 'inlined' by using the 'inline' package which will
        create a C++ function and compile, link and load it given the
        'inlined' character argument which makes C++ integration very
        easy.
 .
 Several examples are included.
