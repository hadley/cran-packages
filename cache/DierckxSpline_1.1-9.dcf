Description: 
  This package provides a wrapper to the FITPACK routines written by
  Paul Dierckx. The original Fortran is available from
  http://www.netlib.org/dierckx
  2012.02.15:  This package is broken.
  Currently, it seems NOT to have any users and is not worth fixing.
  These FITPACK routines are over 20 years old and may be obsolete.
  If you want to fix it, I will happily make you the maintainer.
