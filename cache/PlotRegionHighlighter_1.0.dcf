Description: Creates an envelope around a set of plotted points. The
        envelope is compact with a boundary that is continuous, smooth
        and convex. Each point is represented as a circle and the
        circles and connecting lines are the solution to the multiple
        pulley problem. This method can be used to highlight regions in
        a two-dimensional space.
