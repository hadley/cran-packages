Description: CBPS is an R package that implements the covariate
        balancing propensity score proposed by Imai and Ratkovic
        (2012).  The propensity score is estimated such that it
        maximizes the resulting covariate balance as well as the
        prediction of treatment assignment.  The method, therefore,
        avoids an iteration between model fitting and balance checking.
        Currently, the package can only deal with binary treatment in
        the cross section setting but in the future it will be extended
        to other settings including non-binary treatments and causal
        inference with longitudinal data.
