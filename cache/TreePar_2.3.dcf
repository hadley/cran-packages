Description: (i) For a given species phylogeny on present day data
        which is calibrated to calendar-time, a method for estimating
        maximum likelihood speciation and extinction processes is
        provided. The method allows for non-constant rates. Rates may
        change (1) as a function of time, i.e. rate shifts at specified
        times or mass extinction events (implemented as bd.shifts.optim
        and visualized as bd.shifts.plot) or (2) as a function of the
        number of species, i.e. density-dependence (implemented as
        bd.densdep.optim). Note that the method takes into account the
        whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the "pull of the
        present" effect. Both models can take into account incomplete
        species sampling, as long as each species has the same
        probability of being sampled. For a given phylogeny on higher
        taxa (i.e. all but one species per taxa are mission), but where
        the number of species is known within each higher taxa,
        speciation and extinction rates can be estimated under model
        (1) (implemented as bd.shifts.optim with groups !=0). (ii) For
        a given phylogeny with sequentially sampled tips, e.g. a virus
        phylogeny, rates can be estimated under a model where rates
        vary across time using bdsky.stt.optim (extending
        bd.shifts.optim). Furthermore rates may vary as a function of
        host types using bdtypes.stt.lik (multitype branching process
        extending functions in R package diversitree).
