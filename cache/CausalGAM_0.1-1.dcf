Description: This package implements various estimators for average
        treatment effects---an inverse probability weighted (IPW)
        estimator, an augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW)
        estimator, and a standard regression estimator---that make use
        of generalized additive models for the treatment assignment
        model and/or outcome model.
