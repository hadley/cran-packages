        sparse and unordered data

Description: Treelets provides a novel construction of multi-scale
        bases that extends wavelets to non-smooth signals. It returns a
        multi-scale orthonormal basis, where the final computed basis
        functions are supported on nested clusters in a hierarchical
        tree.  Both the tree and the basis, which are constructed
        simultaneously, reflect the internal structure of the data.
