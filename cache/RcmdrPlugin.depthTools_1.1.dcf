Description: This package provides an Rcmdr plug-in based on the
        depthTools package, which implements different robust
        statistical tools for the description and analysis of gene
        expression data based on the Modified Band Depth, namely, the
        scale curves for visualizing the dispersion of one or various
        groups of samples (e.g. types of tumors), a rank test to decide
        whether two groups of samples come from a single distribution
        and two methods of supervised classification techniques, the DS
        and TAD methods.
