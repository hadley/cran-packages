Description: dglars implements the differential geometric extension of
        the least angle regression method for logistic and Poisson
        regression models. To compute the implicitly defined solution
        curve, two different algorithms are implemented, i.e. the
        predictor-corrector method and the cyclic coordinate descent
        method.
