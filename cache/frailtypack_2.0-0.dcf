Description: Fit a shared gamma frailty model and Cox proportional hazards model using a Penalized Likelihood 
             on the hazard function. Left truncated, censored data and strata (max=2) are allowed. Clustered and 
             recurrent survival times can be studied  (the  Andersen-Gill (1982) approach has been implemented 
             for recurrent events). An automatic choice of the smoothing parameter is possible using an approximated  
             cross-validation procedure.
