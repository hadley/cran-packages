Description: This package contains functions to compute the
        nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the
        bivariate distribution of (X,Y), when realizations of (X,Y)
        cannot be observed directly.  To be more precise, we consider
        the situation where we observe a set of rectangles that are
        known to contain the unobservable realizations of (X,Y). We
        compute the MLE based on such a set of rectangles.  The methods
        can also be used for univariate censored data (see data set
        'cosmesis'), and for censored data with competing risks (see
        data set 'menopause').  We also provide functions to visualize
        the observed data and the MLE.
