Description: This package provides some useful functions for calculating quality measures for adjustment,
	     including statistics Cramer-von Mises and Anderson-Darling. These statistics are often used
             to compare models not equipped. Also provided are other measures of fitness, such as AIC, CAIC
             and BIC. The package also provides functions for generating pseudo-random number of random variables
             that follow the following probability distributions: Exponentiated Weibull, Kumaraswamy Weibull, 
             Kumaraswamy Weibull Poisson.
