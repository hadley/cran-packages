Description: Package EDISON (Estimation of Directed Interactions from
        Sequences Of Nonhomogeneous gene expression) runs an MCMC
        simulation to reconstruct networks from time series data, using
        a non-homogeneous, time-varying dynamic Bayesian network.
        Networks segments and changepoints are inferred concurrently,
        and information sharing priors provide a reduction of the
        inference uncertainty.
