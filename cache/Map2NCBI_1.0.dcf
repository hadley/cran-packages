Description: Map2NCBI is an R package that allows the user to generate a list of 
    features (gene, pseudo, RNA, CDS, and/or UTR) directly from NCBI database for 
    any species with a current build available. Option to save downloaded and 
    formatted files is available, and the user can prioritize the feature list 
    based on type and assembly builds present in the current build used. The user 
    can then use the list of features generated or provide a list to map a set of 
    markers (designed for SNP markers with a single base pair position available) 
    to the closest feature based on the map build. This function does require map 
    positions of the markers to be provided and the positions should be based on 
    the build being queried through NCBI.
