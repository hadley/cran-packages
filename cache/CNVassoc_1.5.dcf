Description: This package carries out association analysis of common
        copy number variants in population-based studies. This package
        includes functions for analysing association under a series of
        study designs (case-control, cohort, etc), using several
        dependent variables (class status, censored data, counts) as
        response, adjusting for covariates and considering various
        inheritance models. It also includes functions for inferring
        copy number (CNV genotype calling).  Various classes and
        methods for generic functions (print, summary, plot, anova, ...
        ) have been created to facilitate the analysis.
