BundleDescription: EmpiricalBayes provides a simple solution to the extreme 		   multiple testing problem by estimating local false
		   discovery rates. It contains two packages, 				   localFDR and HighProbability. Given a vector of p-			   values, localFDR estimates local false discovery rates 		   and HighProbability determines which p-values are low 		   enough that their alternative hypotheses can be 			   considered highly probable .
