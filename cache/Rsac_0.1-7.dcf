Title: Seismic analysis tools in R
Description: The functions in this package are mostly designed to
  reproduce the most commonly used functions in the LLNL software
  Seismic Analysis Code (SAC, http://www.llnl.gov/sac/). This includes
  reading standard binary SAC (and also SEGY) files, plotting
  arrays of seismic recordings (the "SAC" plotting style), filtering
  (highpass, lowpass, and bandpass IIR filters), integration, and
  differentiation.
