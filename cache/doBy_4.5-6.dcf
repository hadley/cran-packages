Description: doBy originally contained facilities to 'do something' to
        data where data is partitioned 'by' some variables which define
        groupings of data - hence the name doBy. doBy contains a
        variety of utilities including:
 .
 1) Facilities for groupwise computations of summary statistics and
        other facilities for working with grouped data.
 .
 2) General linear contrasts and LSMEANS (least-squares-means also known
        as population means),
 .
 3) other utilities.
