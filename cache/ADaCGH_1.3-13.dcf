Description: Analysis and plotting of array CGH data. Allows usage of
        Circular Binary Segementation, wavelet-based smoothing (both as
        in Liu et al., and HaarSeg as in Ben-Yaacov and Eldar), , ACE
        method (CGH Explorer), HMM, BioHMM, GLAD, CGHseg, and Price's
        modification of Smith & Waterman's algorith. Most computations
        are parallelized. Figures are imagemaps with links to IDClight
        (http://idclight.bioinfo.cnio.es).
