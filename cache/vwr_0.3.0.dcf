Description: Functions and data for use in visual word recognition research: 
	 Computation of neighbors (Hamming and Levenshtein
	 distances), average distances to neighbors (e.g., OLD20),
	 and Coltheart's N. Also includes the LD1NN algorithm to
	 detect bias in the composition of a lexical decision task. Most of
	 the functions support parallel execution. Supplies wordlists for 
	 several languages. Uses the string distance functions from the stringdist package by Mark van der Loo.
