Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications The RInside
        packages makes it easier to have 'R inside' your C++
        application by providing a C++ wrapper class providing the R
        interpreter.
 .
 As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build
        of R is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows
        provided you use the same tools used to build R itself.
 .
 Numerous examples are provided in the six subdirectories of the
        examples/ directory of the installed package: standard, mpi
        (for parallel computing) qt (showing how to embed RInside
        inside a Qt GUI application), wt (showing how to build a
        'web-application' using the Wt toolkit), armadillo (for RInside
        use with RcppArmadillo) and eigen (for RInside use with
        RcppEigen).
 .
 Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++ classes is available at the
        RInside website as well.
