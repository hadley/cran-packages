Description: Functions for specifying and fitting marginal models for
        contingency tables proposed by Bergsma and Rudas (2002) here
        called hierarchical multinomial marginal models (hmmm) and
        their extensions presented by Bartolucci et al.  (2007);
        multinomial Poisson homogeneous (mph) models and homogeneous
        linear predictor (hlp) models for contingency tables proposed
        by Lang (2004) and (2005); hidden Markov models where the
        distribution of the observed variables is described by a
        marginal model.  Inequality constraints on the parameters are
        allowed and can be tested.
