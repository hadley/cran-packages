Title: Function GUI
Author: Thomas Hoffmann <tjhoffm@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Thomas Hoffmann <tjhoffm@gmail.com>
Imports: tcltk
Suggests: tcltk
Description: Rapidly create a GUI interface for a function you created
        by automatically creating widgets for arguments of the
        function. Automatically parses help routines for
        context-sensative help to these arguments. The interface
        essentially a wrapper to some tcltk routines to both simplify
        and facilitate GUI creation. More advanced tcltk routines/GUI
        objects can be incorporated into the interface for greater
        customization for the more experienced.
