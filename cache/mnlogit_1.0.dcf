Description: Time and memory efficient estimation of multinomial logit models using maximum likelihood method. Numerical optimization performed by Newton-Raphson method using an optimized, parallel C++ library to achieve fast computation of Hessian matrices. Motivated by large scale multiclass classification problems in econometrics and machine learning.
