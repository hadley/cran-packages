Description: Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Stochastic Frontier
        Production and Cost Functions. Two specifications are
        available: the error components specification with time-varying
        efficiencies (Battese and Coelli, 1992) and a model
        specification in which the firm effects are directly influenced
        by a number of variables (Battese and Coelli, 1995).
