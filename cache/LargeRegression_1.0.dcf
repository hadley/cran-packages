Description: Uses gradient descent to minimize the sum of squared
        residuals for the regression problem.  Can include an L2
        penalty on the coefficient matrix. This function is very useful
        when there is an initial guess of what B should be in Y = XB.
        In general, this function performs faster than R's lm function.
        GPU acceleration can be used to make this function extremely
        fast.  This package suggests cudaMatrixOps, which is not on
        CRAN but can be downloaded at stanford.edu/~jeffwong.
