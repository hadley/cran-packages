Description: This package contains functions for: estimation of the
        variogram through trimmed mean, radial basis functions
        (optimization, prediction and cross-validation), summary
        statistics from cross-validation, pocket plot, and design of
        optimal sampling networks through sequential and simultaneous
        points methods
