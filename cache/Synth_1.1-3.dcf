Description: Implements the synthetic control group method for
        comparative case studies developed in Abadie and Gardeazabal
        (2003) and Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010).  The
        synthetic control method allows for effect estimation in
        settings where a single unit (a state, country, firm, etc.) is
        exposed to an event or intervention.  It provides a data-driven
        procedure to construct synthetic control units based on a
        weighted combination of comparison units that approximates the
        characteristics of the unit that is exposed to the
        intervention. A combination of comparison units often provides
        a better comparison for the unit exposed to the intervention
        than any comparison unit alone.
