Description: Decomposes the empirical Brier score into reliability, resolution and uncertainty. Two different estimators for the components are provided: The original estimators proposed by Murphy (1974), and the bias-corrected estimators proposed by Ferro and Fricker (2012). Sampling variances of all the components are estimated. This package applies only to probabilistic predictions of binary events.
