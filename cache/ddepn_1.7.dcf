Description: Given a matrix of reverse-phase-protein-array timecourse
        data, containing one or more experimental measurements for the
        signalling patterns among proteins in cells, the package
        attempts to model the time-dependent propagation of active and
        passive states depending on a network. The most likely network
        structure given the data is reconstructed.
