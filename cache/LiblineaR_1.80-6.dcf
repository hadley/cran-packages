Description: This R package is a wrapper around the liblinear C/C++
        library for machine learning. LIBLINEAR is a linear classifier
        for data with millions of instances and features. It supports
        L2-regularized classifiers (such as L2-loss linear SVM, L1-loss
        linear SVM, and logistic regression) as well as L1-regularized
        classifiers (such as L2-loss linear SVM and logistic
        regression). The main features of LiblineaR include multi-class
        classification (one-vs-the rest, and Crammer & Singer method),
        cross validation for model selection, probability estimates
        (logistic regression only) or weights for unbalanced data. The
        estimation of the models is particularly fast as compared to
        other libraries. For more information on the C/C++ liblinear
        library itself, refer to R.-E. Fan, K.-W. Chang, C.-J. Hsieh,
        X.-R. Wang, and C.-J. Lin. LIBLINEAR: A Library for Large
        Linear Classification, Journal of Machine Learning Research
        9(2008), 1871-1874, available at
        http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear . The two first
        blocks of the package version indicates which version of
        liblinear is currently supported. For example: 1.32-14 means
        that the package supports the version 1.32 of liblinear.
