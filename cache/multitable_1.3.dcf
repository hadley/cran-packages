Description: Many data sets do not easily fit into a single data frame.
        Storing such data in a single data frame often results in
        either large numbers of meaningless missing values or storage
        of redundant information; yet storing them in multiple data
        frames often results in long difficult-to-read workflows.  The
        multitable package introduces a new data object called a
        data.list, which organises several data tables as a single R
        object.  The primary goal of multitable is to provide a more
        intuitive framework for manipulating multiple-table data in R.
        As data.lists can be coerced to data.frames, they can be used
        with all R functions that accept an object that is coercible to
        a data.frame (e.g. lm; plot; lme; and many more).
