Description: This package estimates factor analysis models using a
        genetic algorithm, which permits a general mechanism for
        restricted optimization with arbitrary restrictions that are
        chosen at run time with the help of a GUI. Importantly,
        inequality restrictions can be imposed on functions of multiple
        parameters, which provides a new avenues for testing and
        generating theories with factor analysis models. This package
        also includes an entirely new estimator of the common factor
        analysis model called semi-exploratory factor analysis, which
        is a general alternative to exploratory and confirmatory factor
        analysis. Finally, this package integrates a lot of other
        packages that estimate sample covariance matrices and thus
        provides a lot of alternatives to the traditional sample
        covariance calculation. Note that you need to have the Gtk run
        time library installed on your system to use this package; see
        the URL below for detailed installation instructions. Most
        users would only need to understand the first twenty-four pages
        of the PDF manual.
