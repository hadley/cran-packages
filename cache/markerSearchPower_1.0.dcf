Description: This package calcuates statistical power of detecting
        associated markers based on one of the model selection
        strategies: marginal selection, exhaustive search, or forward
        selection. With assumed genetic effects (including interaction
        effect), allele frequencies, noise level, sample size, number
        of genotyped markers, and control level (i.e. number of
        markers/models intended to select), this package provides fast
        and accurate consultation on power of different model selection
        strategies. It helps researchers to decide a more efficient way
        for marker detection in genome-wide association studies.
