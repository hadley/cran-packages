Description: An S4 representation of the Command design pattern. The
        Operation class is a simple implementation using closures and
        supports forward and reverse (undo) evaluation. The more
        complicated Protocol framework represents each type of command
        (or analytical protocol) by a formal S4 class. Commands may be
        grouped and consecutively executed using the Pipeline class.
        Example use cases include logging, do/undo, analysis pipelines,
        GUI actions, parallel processing, etc.
