Package: turboEM
Title: A Suite of Convergence Acceleration Schemes for EM and MM
        algorithms
Description: Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow, monotone  sequences from smooth, contraction mapping such as the EM and MM algorithms. It can be used to accelerate any smooth, linearly convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style introduction to this package is available in a vignette on the CRAN download page or, when the package is loaded in an R session, with vignette("turboEM").
