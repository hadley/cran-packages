Description: Functions for fitting multi-state semi-Markov models to
        longitudinal data. A parametric maximum likelihood estimation
        method adapted to deal with Exponential, Weibull and
        Exponentiated Weibull distributions is considered.
        Right-censoring can be taken into account and both constant and
        time-varying covariates can be included using a Cox
        proportional model.
