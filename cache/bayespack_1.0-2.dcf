Description: The bayespack package provides an R interface to the
        Fortran BAYESPACK integration routines written by Alan Genz.
        Given an unnormalized posterior distribution, the BAYESPACK
        routines approximate the normalization constant and the mean
        and covariance of the posterior. Posterior means of additional
        functions of the parameters can be calculated as well.
