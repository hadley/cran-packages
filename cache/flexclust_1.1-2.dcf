Description: The main function kcca implements a general framework for
  k-centroids cluster analysis supporting arbitrary distance measures
  and centroid computation. Further cluster methods include hard
  competitive learning, neural gas, and QT clustering. There are
  numerous visualization methods for cluster results (neighborhood
  graphs, convex cluster hulls, barcharts of centroids, ...), and
  bootstrap methods for the analysis of cluster stability.
