Description: Collection of convenience functions to make working with
    administrative records easier and more consistent. Includes functions to
    clean strings, identify cutpoints, and quickly combine shapefiles and
    dataframes for plotting. Includes four alternative themes for ggplot2 as
    well as a wrapper for exporting graphics for inclusion in MS Office
    products. Also includes three example datasets of administrative education
    records for learning how to process records with errors.
