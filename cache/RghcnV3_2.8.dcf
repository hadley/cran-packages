        download and format the GHCN V3 data and process it into
        temperature series and temperature anomaly series. The data is
        reformated so that integration with objects in the system is
        straightforward.  In addition, there are core functions
        required to download and create land masks and functions to
        download and import Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data.
