Title: Accurate Numerical Derivatives
Description: This package provide methods for calculating (usually)
        accurate numerical first and second order derivatives. Accurate
        calculations are done using Richardson's extrapolation, but a
        simple difference method is also provided. Simple difference is
        (usually) less accurate but is much quicker and provides a
        useful cross-check. Methods are provided for real scalar and
        vector valued functions.
Depends: R (>= 1.8.1)
