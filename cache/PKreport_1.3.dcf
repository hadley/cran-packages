Description: PKreport aims to 1) provide automatic pipeline for users
        to visualize data and models. It creates a flexible R framework
        with automatically generated R scripts to save time and cost
        for later usage; 2) implement an archive-oriented management
        tool for users to store, retrieve and modify figures. 3) offer
        powerful and convenient service to generate high-quality graphs
        based on two R packages: lattice and ggplot2.
