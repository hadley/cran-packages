Description: This package provides tools for the identification of
        unique of multilocus genotypes when both genotyping error and
        missing data are present. The package is targeted at those
        working with large datasets and databases containing multiple
        samples of each individual, a situation that is common in
        conservation genetics, and particularly in non-invasive
        wildlife sampling applications. Functions explicitly
        incorporate missing data, and can tolerate allele mismatches
        created by genotyping error.
