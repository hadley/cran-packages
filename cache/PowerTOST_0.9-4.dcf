Title: Power and Sample size based on two one-sided t-tests (TOST) for
        (bio)equivalence studies

Description: Contains functions to calculate power and sample size for
        various study designs used for bioequivalence studies.  See
        function known.designs() for study designs covered.  Moreover
        the package contains functions for power and sample size based
        on 'expected' power in case of uncertain (estimated)
        variability.  Added are functions for the power and sample size
        for the ratio of two means with normally distributed data on
        the original scale (based on Fieller's confidence ('fiducial')
        interval).
