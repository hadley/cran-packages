Description: Advanced response surface analyses. The main function RSA
        compares several nested models (full polynomial, shifted and
        rotated squared differences, shifted squared differences, basic
        squared differences) and provides plotting functions for
        wireframe surfaces, interactive 3d plots, and contour plots.
        Calculates many surface parameters and provides standard,
        robust, or bootstrapped standard errors and confidence
        intervals for them.
