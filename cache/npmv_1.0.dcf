Description: Performs analysis of one-way multivariate data, for small
        samples using Nonparametric techniques. Using approximations
        for ANOVA Type, Wilk's Lambda, Lawley Hotelling, and Bartlett
        Nanda Pillai Test statics, the package compares the multvariate
        distributions for a single explanatory variable.  The
        comparision is also performed using a permutation test for each
        of the four test statistics.
