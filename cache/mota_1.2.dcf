Description: Detect nonlinear functional relations. This package was originally 
  designed for the identifiability analysis of nonlinear dynamical models. However,
  the concept is very general and allows to detect groups of functionally related
  variables whenever there are multiple estimates for each variable, which can be written
  in matrix K. The essence of the algorithm is the calculation of mean optimal
  transformations estimated from bootstrap samples drawn from K.
