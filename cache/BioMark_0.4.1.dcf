Title: Find biomarkers in two-class discrimination problems
Version: 0.4.1
Author: Ron Wehrens, Pietro Franceschi
Maintainer: Ron Wehrens <ron.wehrens@fmach.it>
Description: The package provides biomarker selection for several
        classification methods: the lasso/elastic net, PCLDA, PLSDA,
        and several t-tests. Two approaches are provided, one based on
        the stability of model coefficients under perturbation, and the
        other on higher criticism.
