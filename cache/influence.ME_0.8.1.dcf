Description: influence.ME provides a collection of tools for calculating measures of influential data for mixed effects models. It analyses models that were estimated using lme4. The basic rationale behind identifying influential data is that when iteratively single units are omitted from the data, models based on these data should not produce substantially different estimates. To standardize the assessment of how influential a (single group of) observation(s) is, several measures of influence are common practice. First, DFBETAS is a standardized measure of the absolute difference between the estimate with a particular case included and the estimate without that particular case. Second, Cook's distance provides an overall measurement of the change in all parameter estimates, or a selection thereof.
