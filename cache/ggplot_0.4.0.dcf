Description: An implementation of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a more sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attributes. See \url{http://had.co.nz/ggplot/} for more information, documentation and examples.
Suggests: butler, hexbin, mapproj, quantreg, MASS
Depends: R (>= 2.3), grid, reshape (>= 0.6.3), RColorBrewer
