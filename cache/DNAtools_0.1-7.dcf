Description: 
  Computational efficient tools for comparing all pairs of profiles in a DNA database. The expectation and covariance of the summary statistic
  is implemented for fast computing. Routines for estimating proportions of close related individuals are available. The use of wildcards (also
  called F-designation) is implemented. Dedicated functions ease plotting the results.
