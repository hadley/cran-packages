Description: Node harvest is a simple interpretable tree-like estimator
        for high-dimensional regression and classification. A few nodes
        are selected from an initially large ensemble of nodes, each
        associated with a positive weight. New observations can fall
        into one or several nodes and predictions are the weighted
        average response across all these groups. The package offers
        visualization of the estimator. Predictions can return the
        nodes a new observation fell into, along with the mean response
        of training observations in each node, offering a simple
        explanation of the prediction.
