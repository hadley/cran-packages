Description: The package "nparLD" is designed to perform nonparametric
        analysis of longitudinal data in factorial experiments.
        Longitudinal data are those which are collected from the same
        subjects over time, and they frequently arise in biological
        sciences. Nonparametric methods do not require assumptions on
        distributions of parameters, and are applicable to a variety of
        data types (continuous, discrete, purely ordinal, and
        dichotomous). Such methods are also robust with respect to
        outliers and for small sample sizes.
