Title: Generic Reproducible Parallel Backend for foreach Loops
Version: 1.0.2
Date: 2010-08-20
Author: Renaud Gaujoux
Maintainer: Renaud Gaujoux <renaud@cbio.uct.ac.za>
Description: This package provides functions to perform reproducible
        parallel foreach loops, using independent random streams as
        generated by the package rstream. It enables to easily convert
        standard %dopar% loops into fully reproducible loops,
        independently of the number of workers, the task scheduling
        strategy, or the chosen parallel environment and associated
        foreach backend.
