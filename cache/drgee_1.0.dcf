Description: The package provides functions to estimate parameters quantifying
  an association between an exposure and an outcome in a generalized
  estimating equations model in the presence of nuisance variables. Three methods are implemented:
  outcome nuisance model based estimation where a model for the association
  between the nuisance factors and the outcome is assumed, exposure nuisance model
  based estimation where a model for the association between the nuisance factors
  and the exposure is assumed and doubly robust estimation where both models are
  used. In doubly robust estimation, the estimates will be consistent when
  at least one of the models are correctly specified, not necessarily both.
