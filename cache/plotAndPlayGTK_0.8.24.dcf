Description: A GUI (using GTK+) for interactive plots in R. Just wrap it around a plot 
  command, like plotAndPlay(plot(1:10)), and you have buttons to move around, 
  change scales, identify data points, and save the plot in several formats.
  For multi-variate scatterplots (splom only) there is a "brush" function, and
  for 3D plots (wireframe / cloud only) there is a simple zoom and rotate.
  New buttons can also be defined, with user-supplied call-back functions.  
  It is most suited to the Lattice paradigm, and there is support for multiple 
  Lattice panels and pages. Traditional plots will need to be wrapped up into a 
  single function call, and the interaction features do not work well with 
  multiple-plot layouts. 
  Also included in this package are several utilities for RGtk2 applications.
