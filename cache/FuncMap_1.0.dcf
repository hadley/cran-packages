Description: FuncMap analyzes the function calls in an R package and
        creates a hive plot of the calls, dividing them among functions
        that only make outgoing calls (sources), functions that have
        only incoming calls (sinks), and those that have both incoming
        calls and make outgoing calls (managers).  Function calls can
        be mapped by their absolute numbers, their normalized absolute
        numbers, or their rank.  FuncMap should be useful for comparing
        packages at a high level for their overall design.  Plus, it's
        just plain fun.  The hive plot concept was developed by Martin
        Krzywinski (mkweb.bcgsc.ca/linnet/) and inspired this package.
