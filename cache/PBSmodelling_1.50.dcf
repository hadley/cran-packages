Description: PBS Modelling provides software to facilitate the design,
  testing, and operation of computer models. It focuses particularly on
  tools that make it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical
  user interface (GUI). Although it depends heavily on the R interface
  to the Tcl/Tk package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. The
  package contains examples that illustrate models built with other R
  packages, including PBS Mapping, odesolve, ddesolvem, and BRugs. 
  It also serves as a convenient prototype for building new R packages, 
  along with instructions and batch files to facilitate that process. 
  The root library directory of PBSmodelling includes a complete user guide
  PBSmodelling-UG.pdf. To use this package effectively, please consult
  the guide.
