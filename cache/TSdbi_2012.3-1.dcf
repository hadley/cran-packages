Title: Time Series Database Interface
Description: TSdbi provides a common interface to time series
        databases. The objective is to define a standard interface so
        users can retrieve time series data from various sources with a
        simple, common, set of commands, and so programs can be written
        to be portable with respect to the data source. The SQL
        implementations also provide a database table design, so users
        needing to set up a time series database have a reasonably
        complete way to do this easily. The interface provides for a
        variety of options with respect to the representation of time
        series in R. There is also a (not yet well tested) mechanism to
        handle multilingual data documentation.
