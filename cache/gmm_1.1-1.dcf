Title: Generalized Method of Moments and Generalized Empirical
        Likelihood
Author: Pierre Chausse <pierre.chausse@uqam.ca>
Maintainer: Pierre Chausse <pierre.chausse@uqam.ca>
Description: It is a complete suite to estimate models based on moment
        conditions. It includes the two step Generalized method of
        moments (GMM) of Hansen(1982), the iterated GMM and continuous
        updated estimator (CUE) of Hansen-Eaton-Yaron(1996) and several
        methods that belong to the Generalized Empirical Likelihood
        (GEL) family of estimators, as presented by Smith(1997),
        Kitamura(1997), Newey-Smith(2004) and Anatolyev(2005).
