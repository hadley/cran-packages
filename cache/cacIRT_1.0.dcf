Description: Computes classification accuracy and consistency under
        Item Response Theory by the approach proposed by Lee, Hanson &
        Brennen (2002) and Lee (2010) or the approach proposed by
        Rudner (2001, 2005). [Currently, only works for 3PL IRT models
        (or 2PL or 1PL) (future updates should include polytomous
        models), and only independent cut scores (imputing multiple cut
        scores will apply them independently but not simultaneously).]
