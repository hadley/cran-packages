Description: birch is an implementation of the algorithms described in
        Zhang et al (1997), and provides functions for creating
        CF-trees, along with algorithms for dealing with some
        combinatorial problems, such as covMcd and ltsReg. It is very
        well suited for dealing with very large data sets, and does not
        require that the data can fit in physical memory.
