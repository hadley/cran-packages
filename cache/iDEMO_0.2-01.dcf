Description: The package iDEMO written in R and R GUI is a tool to
        build a linear degradation model which can simultaneously
        consider the unit-to-unit variation, time-dependent structure
        and measurement error in the degradation paths. Moreover, we
        provide the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the unknown
        parameters, mean-time-to-failure (MTTF) and qth quantile, and
        their corresponding confidence intervals.
