Description: MPTinR provides a user-friendly way for the analysis of
        multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (e.g., Riefer, D. M.,
        and Batchelder, W. H. [1988]. Multinomial modeling and the
        measurement of cognitive processes. Psychological Review, 95,
        318-339) for single and multiple datasets. The main functions
        perform model fitting and model selection. Model selection can
        be done using AIC, BIC, or the Fisher Information Approximation
        (FIA) a measure based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL)
        framework. The model and restrictions can specified in external
        files or within an R script in an intuitive syntax. The
        'classical' .EQN file format for model files is also supported.
        Besides MPTs, MPTinR can fit a wide variety of other cognitive
        models such as SDT models (see fit.model). MPTinR supports
        multicore fitting using the snowfall package.
