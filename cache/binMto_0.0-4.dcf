Description: Asymptotic simultaneous confidence intervals for
        comparison of many treatments with one control, for the
        difference of binomial proportions, allows for
        Dunnett-like-adjustment, Bonferroni or unadjusted intervals.
        Simulation of power of the above interval methods, approximate
        calculation of any-pair-power, and sample size iteration based
        on approximate any-pair power. Exact conditional maximum test
        for many-to-one comparisons to a control.
