Package: HighProbability
Title: HighProbability estimates which alternative hypotheses have frequentist or Bayesian probabilities at least as great as a specified threshold, given a list of p-values.
Version: 1.0-2
Author: David R. Bickel
Description: HighProbability provides a simple, fast, reliable solution to the multiple testing problem. Given a vector of p-values or achieved significance levels computed using standard frequentist inference, HighProbability determines which ones are low enough that their alternative hypotheses can be considered highly probable. The p-value vector may be determined using existing R functions such as t.test, wilcox.test, cor.test, or sample. HighProbability can be used to detect differential gene expression and to solve other problems involving a large number of hypothesis tests.
