Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes

Description: Functions for performing hierarchical analysis of distance
        sampling data, with ability to use an areal spatial ICAR model
        on top of user supplied covariates to get at variation in
        abundance intensity.  The detection model can be specified as a
        function of observer and individual covariates, where a
        parametric model is supposed for the population level
        distribution of covariate values.  The model uses data
        augmentation and a reversible jump MCMC algorithm to sample
        animals that were never observed.  Also included is the ability
        to include point independence (increasing correlation multiple
        observer's observations as a function of distance, with
        independence assumed for distance=0 or first distance bin).
        New in version 2.0 is the ability to model species
        misclassification rates using a multinomial logit formulation
        on data from double observers.
