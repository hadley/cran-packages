Description: Package implements Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares
        (KRLS), a machine learning method that can be used to fit
        multidimensional functions for regression and classification
        problems without relying on linearity or additivity
        assumptions. This package is currently in alpha phase (feedback
        is appreciated).
