Title: Resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing
Version: 1.8.0
Author: Katherine S. Pollard, Yongchao Ge, Sandrine Dudoit
Description: Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple testing procedures for controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR). Single-step and step-wise methods are implemented. Tests based on a variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on regression parameters from linear and survival models) are included. Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confindence regions and test statistic cutoffs.
