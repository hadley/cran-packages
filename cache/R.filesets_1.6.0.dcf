Description: A file set refers to a set of files located in one or more
        directories on the file system.  This package provides classes
        and methods to locate, setup, subset, navigate and iterate
        suchs sets.  The API is designed such that these classes can be
        extended via inheritance to provide a richer API for special
        file formats.  Moreover, a specific name format is defined such
        that filenames and directories can be considered to have
        fullnames which consists of a name followed by comma-separated
        tags.  This adds additional flexibility to identify file sets
        and individual files.  NOTE: This package's API should be
        considered to be in an beta stage.  Its main purpose is
        currently to support the aroma.* packages, where it is one of
        the main core components; if you decide to build on top of this
        package, please contact the author first.
