Description: influence.ME provides a collection of tool for calculating
        measures of influential data for mixed effects models. The
        basic rationale behind identifying influential data is that
        when iteratively single units are omitted from the data, models
        based on these data should not produce substantially different
        estimates. To standardize the assessment of how influential a
        (single group of) observation(s) is, several measures of
        influence are common practice. First, DFBETAS is a standardized
        measure of the absolute difference between the estimate with a
        particular case included and the estimate without that
        particular case. Second, Cook's distance provides an overall
        measurement of the change in all parameter estimates, or a
        selection thereof.
