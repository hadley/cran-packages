Title: Non-Negative Sparse PCA
Description: This package implements two methods for performing a constrained
    principal component analysis (PCA), where non-negativity and/or sparsity
    constraints are enforced on the principal axes (PAs). The function
    'nsprcomp' computes one principal component (PC) after the other. Each PA
    is optimized such that the corresponding PC has maximum additional variance
    not explained by the previous components. In contrast, the function
    'nscumcomp' jointly computes all PCs such that the cumulative variance is
    maximal. Both functions have the same interface as the 'prcomp' function
    from the 'stats' package (plus some extra parameters), and both return the
    result of the analysis as an object of class 'nsprcomp', which inherits
    from 'prcomp'.
