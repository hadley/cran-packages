        times
Author: David Clement
Maintainer: David Clement <dyc24@cornell.edu>
Depends: R (>= 2.01), numDeriv, rootSolve
Description: Solves for the mean parameters, the variance parameter,
        and their asymptotic variance in a conditional GEE for
        recurrent event gap times, as described by Clement and
        Strawderman (2009) in the journal Biostatistics. Makes a
        parametric assumption for the length of the censored gap time.
