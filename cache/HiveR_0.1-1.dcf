Description: HiveR is an R package for creating and plotting 2D and 3D
        hive plots. Hive plots are a unique method of displaying
        networks of many types in which node properties are mapped to
        axes using meaningful properties rather than being arbitrarily
        positioned.  The hive plot concept was invented by Martin
        Kryzwinski at the Genome Science Center (www.hiveplot.net/).
        Keywords: networks, food webs, linnet.
