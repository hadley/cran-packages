Description: Parametric linkage analysis and other likelihood-based
        pedigree analyses based on the Elston-Stewart algorithm,
        including singlepoint LOD scores, power analysis and various
        marker genotype distributions. Multipoint analysis is provided
        through a convenient MERLIN wrapper. Includes many utility
        functions for creating, manipulating and plotting pedigrees,
        markers and linkage results.
Depends: R (>= 2.12), kinship2
SystemRequirements: For the MERLIN wrapper, MERLIN from
        \url{www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/merlin} must be installed
        and pointed to in the PATH environment variable.
