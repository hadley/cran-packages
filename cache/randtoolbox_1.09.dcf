        Wuertz (except underlying C codes of (i) the SFMT algorithm
        from M. Matsumoto and M. Saito, (ii) the Knuth-TAOCP RNG from
        D. Knuth). See LICENCE file for details.

Description: The package provides (1) pseudo random generators -
        general linear congruential generators (Park Miller) and
        multiple recursive generators (Knuth TAOCP), generalized
        feedback shift register (SF-Mersenne Twister algorithm and WELL
        generators); (2) quasi random generators - the Torus algorithm,
        the Sobol sequence, the Halton sequence (thus include Van der
        Corput sequence) and (3) some additional tests such as the gap
        test, the serial test, the poker test... For true random number
        generation, use the 'random' package, for Latin Hypercube
        Sampling (a hybrid qmc method), use the 'lhs' package, a number
        of RNGs and tests for RNGs are provided by 'RDieHarder', all
        available on CRAN. There is also a small stand-alone package
        'rngwell19937' for the WELL19937a RNG.
