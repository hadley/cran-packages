Description: Random number generator WELL19937a by F. Panneton, P.
        L'Ecuyer and M. Matsumoto with initialization using MRG32k5a by
        P. L'Ecuyer. WELL19937a is of similar type as Mersenne Twister
        and has the same period. WELL19937a is slightly slower than
        Mersenne Twister, but has better equidistribution and
        "bit-mixing" properties and faster recovery from states with
        prevailing zeros than Mersenne Twister. The output function may
        be set to provide numbers with 53 or 32 random bits.
