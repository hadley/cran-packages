Description: This is an R-Commander plug-in for the MAd package
        (Meta-Analysis with Mean Differences). This package enables the
        user to conduct a meta-analysis in a menu-driven, graphical
        user interface environment (e.g., SPSS), while having the full
        statistical capabilities of R and the MAd package. The MAd
        package itself contains a variety of useful functions for
        conducting a research synthesis with mean differences data. One
        of the unique features of the MAd package is in its integration
        of user-friendly functions to complete many of the statistical
        steps involved in a meta-analysis with mean differences. It
        uses recommended procedures as described in The Handbook of
        Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Cooper, Hedges, &
        Valentine, 2009).
