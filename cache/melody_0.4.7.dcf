Description: The melody package is a suite of computer vision tools for
        processing vocal spectrograms.  In addition to temporal
        partitioning, unit filtering, harmonic splitting, and
        background noise removal functionality, the package provides a
        collection of methods for assessing the higher order melodic
        content of vocalization spectrograms. Both unit level (tone and
        interval) as well as inter-unit measures (syllabic variation
        and repetition clustering) are also currently available.
