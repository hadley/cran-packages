Title: create and investigate magic squares
Author: Robin K. S. Hankin
Depends: R (>= 2.4.0), abind
Description: a collection of efficient, vectorized algorithms for the
        creation and investigation of magic squares and hypercubes,
        including a variety of functions for the manipulation and
        analysis of arbitrarily dimensioned arrays.  The package
        includes methods for creating normal magic squares of any order
        greater than 2.  The ultimate intention is for the package to
        be a computerized embodiment all magic square knowledge,
        including direct numerical verification of properties of magic
        squares (such as recent results on the determinant of
        odd-ordered semimagic squares).  Some antimagic functionality
        is included.  The package also serves as a rebuttal to the
        often-heard comment "I thought R was just for statistics".
