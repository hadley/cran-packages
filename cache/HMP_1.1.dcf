Description: This package provides several functions to perform formal
        hypothesis testing, and power and sample size calculations for
        human microbiome experiments. Dirichlet-Multinomial
        distribution is proposed for modeling the species abundance
        distributions of human microbiota (ranked bacterial taxa
        counts).
