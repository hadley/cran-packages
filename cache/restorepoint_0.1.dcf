Description: Debugging with restore points instead of break points. A
        restore point stores all local variables when called inside a
        function. The stored values can later be retrieved and
        evaluated in a modified R console that replicates the
        function's environment. To debug step by step, one can simply
        copy & paste the function body from the R script. Particularly
        convenient in combination with RStudio.
