Description: This package provides a flexible framework for the Item
        Response Theory analysis of dichotomous and ordinal polytomous
        outcomes under the assumption of multidimensionality and
        discreteness of the latent traits. The fitting algorithms allow
        for missing responses and for different item parameterizations
        and are based on the Expectation-Maximization paradigm.
        Individual covariates affecting the class weights may be
        included in the new version (since 2.1).
