Description: In the field of sampling design (in particular for
        stratified sampling), this package offers an approach for the
        determination of the best stratification of a sampling frame,
        the one that ensures the minimum sample size under the
        condition to satisfy precision constraints in a multivariate
        and multidomain case. This approach is based on the use of the
        genetic algorithm: each solution (i.e. a particular partition
        in strata of the sampling frame) is considered as an individual
        in a population; the fitness of all individuals is evaluated by
        calculating (using the Bethel-Chromy algorithm) the sampling
        size satisfying accuracy constraints on the target estimates.
        Functions in the package allows to: (a) analyse the obtained
        results of the optimisation step; (b) assign the new strata
        labels to the sampling frame; (c) select a sample from the new
        frame accordingly to the best allocation. There is also a
        function that allows to build the most important input to the
        optimisation step, i.e. the "strata" dataframe, containing
        information (means and standard errors) regarding the
        distributions of the target variables in the different strata,
        using the sampling frame or using data from previous rounds of
        the same survey.
