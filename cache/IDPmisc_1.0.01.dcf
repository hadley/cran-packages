Description: The IDPmisc package contains different high-level graphics
        functions for displaying large datasets, displaying circular
        data in a very flexible way, finding local maxima, brewing
        color ramps, drawing nice arrows, zooming 2D-plots, creating
        figures with differently colored margin and plot region.  In
        addition, the package contains auxiliary functions for data
        manipulation like omitting observations with irregular values
        or selecting data by logical vectors, which include NAs. Other
        functions are especially useful in spectroscopy and analyses of
        environmental data: robust baseline fitting, finding peaks in
        spectra.
