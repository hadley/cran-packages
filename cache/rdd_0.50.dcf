Description: This package provides the tools to undertake estimation in
        Regression Discontinuity Designs. Both sharp and fuzzy designs
        are supported. Estimation is accomplished using local linear
        regression. A provided function will utilize
        Imbens-Kalyanaraman optimal bandwidth calculation. A function
        is also included to test the assumption of no-sorting effects.
