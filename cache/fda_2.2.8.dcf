Description: These functions were developed to support functional data
        analysis as described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W.
        (2005) Functional Data Analysis. New York: Springer.  They were
        ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An
        introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and
        Graves, Spencer (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and
        Matlab (Springer). The package includes data sets and script
        files working many examples including all but one of the 76
        figures in this latter book.  The principal changes to version
        2.2.8 are: 1.  The use of sparse matrix representation for
        spline basis functions and in function smooth.basis.  2.  The
        correction of a bug in function pca.fd.  Analyses using the
        earlier version should be redone.
