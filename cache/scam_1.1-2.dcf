Description: Routines for generalized additive modelling under shape
        constraints on the component functions of the linear predictor.
        Models can contain multiple shape constrained (univariate
        and/or bivariate) and unconstrained terms. The routines of
        mgcv(gam) package are used for setting up the model matrix,
        printing and plotting the results.  Penalized likelihood
        maximization based on Newton-Raphson method is used to fit a
        model with multiple smoothing parameter selection by GCV or
        UBRE/AIC.
Depends: R (>= 2.3.0)
