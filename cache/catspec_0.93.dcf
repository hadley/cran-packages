Description: `sqtab' contains a set of functions for estimating
  loglinear models for square tables such as quasi-independence,
  symmetry, uniform association.
  `mclgen' restructures a dataframe to enable the estimation of a
  multinomial logistic model using the conditional logit program
  `clogit'. This allows greater flexibility in imposing constraints on
  the response variable. One application is to specify aforementioned
  models for square tables as multinomial logistic models with
  covariates at the respondent level.
  `ctab' simplifies the production of (multiway( percentage tables.
