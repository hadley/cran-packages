Title: Track Objects
Author: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Maintainer: Tony Plate <tplate@acm.org>
Description: Stores objects in files on disk so that files are
  automatically rewritten when objects are changed, and so
  that objects are accessible but do not occupy memory until
  they are accessed. Also tracks times when objects are created
  and modified, and caches some basic characteristics of objects
  to allow for fast summaries of objects.
