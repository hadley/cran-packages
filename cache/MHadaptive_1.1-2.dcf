Description: Performs general Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte
        Carlo sampling of a user defined function which returns the
        un-normalized value (likelihood times prior) of a Bayesian
        model.  The proposal variance-covariance structure is updated
        adaptively for efficient mixing when the structure of the
        target distribution is unknown.  The package also provides some
        functions for Bayesian inference including Bayesian Credible
        Intervals (BCI) and Deviance Information Criterion (DIC)
        calculation.
