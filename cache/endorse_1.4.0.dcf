Description: This R package implements the statistical model proposed
        by Bullock, Imai, and Shapiro (2011; Political Analysis) to
        analyze endorsement experiments.  Endorsement experiments are a
        survey methodology for eliciting truthful responses to
        sensitive questions.  This methodology is helpful when
        measuring support for socially sensitive political actors such
        as militant groups.  The model is fitted with the Markov chain
        Monte Carlo algorithm and produces the output containing draws
        from the posterior distribution.
