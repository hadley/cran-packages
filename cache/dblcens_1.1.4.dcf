Title: Compute the NPMLE of distribution from doubly censored data
Version: 1.1.4
Author: Mai Zhou, Li Lee, Kun Chen.
Description: Use EM algorithm to compute the NPMLE of CDF and also the two
             censoring distributions. For doubly censored data 
             (as described in Chang and Yang (1987) Ann. Stat. 1536-47). 
             You can also specify a constraint, it will return
             the constrained NPMLE and the -2 log empirical likelihood ratio. 
             This can be used to test the hypothesis about the constraint
             and find confidence intervals for F(T) via empirical likelihood 
             ratio theorem.  
             Influence function of hat F may also be calculated 
             (but may be slow).
