Description: Bipartite provides functions to visualise webs and
        calculate a series of indices commonly used to describe pattern
        in ecological webs. It focuses on webs consisting of only two
        trophic levels, e.g. pollination webs or predator-prey-webs.
        Visualisation is important to get an idea of what we are
        actually looking at, while the indices summarise different
        aspects of the webs topology.
