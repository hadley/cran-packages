Description: This package fits the partially linear mixed effects model
        (semiparametric random intercept model) using kernel
        regression, without distributional assumptions for the random
        terms. Estimation procedure is an iterative generalized least
        squares type. A nonparametric heteroskedastic variance function
        is allowed for the regression error. Bootstrap resampling is
        provided for inference. The package implements bandwidth
        selection by an alternative cross validation for correlated
        data.
