Description: RbioRXN is an R package that facilitates retrieving and
        processing biochemical reaction data such as Rhea, MetaCyc,
        BioCyc and EcoCyc. The package provides various functions to
        download and parse data, instantiate generic reaction,
        interchange compound ID among well-known biochemical databases
        (e.g. KEGG, PubChem, and ChEBI) and check mass balance. The
        package aims to construct an integrated metabolic network and
        genome-scale metabolic model
