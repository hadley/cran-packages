Description: Functions for a classification method based on receiver
        operating characteristics (ROC). Briefly, features are selected
        according to their ranked AUC value in the training set. The
        selected features are merged by the mean value to form a
        metagene. The samples are ranked by their metagene value and
        the metagene threshold that has the highest accuracy in
        splitting the training samples is determined. A new sample is
        classified by its metagene value relative to the threshold. In
        the first place, the package is aimed at two class problems in
        gene expression data, but might also apply to other problems.
