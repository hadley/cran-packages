Description: CLAG (for CLusters AGgregation) is an unsupervised non
        hierarchical clustering algorithm designed to cluster a large
        variety of biological data and to provide a clustered matrix
        and numerical values indicating cluster strength. CLAG
        clusterizes correlation matrices for residues in protein
        families, gene-expression and miRNA data related to various
        cancer types, sets of species described by multidimensional
        vectors of characters, binary matrices. It does not ask to all
        data points to cluster and it converges yielding the same
        result at each run. Its simplicity and speed allows it to run
        on reasonably large datasets.
