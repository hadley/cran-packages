Description: Advanced response surface analyses. The function compares
        several nested models (full polynomial, shifted and rotated
        squared differences, shifted squared differences, basic squared
        differenceds). Provides plotting functions for wireframe
        surface, interactive 3d, and contour plots.  Calculates many
        surface parameters and provides standard, robust, or
        bootstrapped SEs and confidence intervals for them.
