Description: An interface to WordNet using the Jawbone Java API to WordNet.
  WordNet is an on-line lexical reference system developed by the Cognitive
  Science Laboratory at Princeton University. Its design is inspired by current
  psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs,
  adjectives and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one
  underlying lexical concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.
