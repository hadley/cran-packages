Description: Takes matched data and calculates Rosenbaum bounds for the
        treatment effect.  Calculates bounds for binary data,
        Hodges-Lehmann point estimates, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and
        for data with multiple matched controls.  Is designed to work
        with the Matching package and operate on Match() objects.
