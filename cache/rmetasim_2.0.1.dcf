Title: An individual-based population genetic simulation environment
License: GPL
Description: An interface between R and the metasim simulation engine.
	     Facilitates the use of the metasim engine to build and
	     run individual based population genetics simulations. The
	     simulation environment is documented in: Allan
	     Strand. Metasim 1.0: an individual-based environment for
	     simulating population genetics of complex population
	     dynamics. Mol. Ecol. Notes, 2:373-376, 2002. (Please
	     contact Allan Strand with comments, bug reports, etc).
	     This version represents a significant alteration of
	     function names that hopefully increases consistency and
	     reduces the chances of collisions with other packages
	     naming conventions.  For a spatially-explicit, but slower, package
	     with a similar interface, see kernelPop
