Description: bayesm covers many important models used
  in marketing and micro-econometrics applications. 
  The package includes:
  Bayes Regression (univariate or multivariate dep var),
  Bayes Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR),
  Binary and Ordinal Probit,
  Multinomial Logit (MNL) and Multinomial Probit (MNP),
  Multivariate Probit,
  Negative Binomial (Poisson) Regression,
  Multivariate Mixtures of Normals (including clustering),
  Hierarchical Linear Models with normal prior and covariates,
  Hierarchical Linear Models with a mixture of normals prior and covariates,
  Hierarchical Multinomial Logits with a mixture of normals prior
     and covariates,
  Hierarchical Negative Binomial Regression Models,
  Bayesian analysis of choice-based conjoint data,
  Bayesian treatment of linear instrumental variables models,
  and
  Analyis of Multivariate Ordinal survey data with scale
     usage heterogeneity (as in Rossi et al, JASA (01)).
