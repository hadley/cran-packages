Description: dlmodeler is a set of user-friendly functions to simplify
        the state-space modelling, fitting, analysis and forecasting of
        Generalized Dynamic Linear Models (DLMs). It includes functions

        classical seasonal time-series models (monthly, quarterly,
        yearly, etc. with calendar adjustments) and provides a unified
        interface compatible with other state-space packages including:
        dlm, FKF and KFAS.
