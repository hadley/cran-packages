        (bio)equivalence studies

Description: Contains functions to calculate power and sample size for
             various study designs used for bioequivalence studies. 
             See function known.designs() for study designs covered. 
             Moreover the package contains functions for power and sample size 
             based on 'expected' power in case of uncertain (estimated) variability.
             Added are functions for the power and sample size for the ratio of 
             two means with normally distributed data on the original scale 
             (based on Fieller's confidence ('fiducial') interval).
