Description: NeMo package aims to extract motifs which are occur more
        frequently than expected in random, in a given network. The
        method used doesn't require any Monte-Carlo based simulations.
        The number of motif occurences is compared (p-value
        calculation) with well-suited count distribution (compound
        Poisson distribution)
