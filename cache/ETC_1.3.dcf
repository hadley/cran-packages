Description: The package allows selecting those treatments of a one-way layout
 being equivalent to a control. Bonferroni adjusted "two one-sided t-tests"
 (TOST) and related simultaneous confidence intervals are given for both
 differences or ratios of means of normally distributed data. For the case of
 equal variances and balanced sample sizes for the treatment groups, the
 single-step procedure of Bofinger and Bofinger (1995) can be chosen. For
 non-normal data, the Wilcoxon test is applied.
