Description: Each function accomplishes the work of several or more
        standard R functions.  For example, two function calls, Read()
        and CountAll(), read the data and generate descriptive
        statistics for all variables in the data frame, plus histograms
        and bar charts as appropriate.  Other functions provide for
        descriptive statistics, a comprehensive regression analysis,
        ANOVA and t-test, plotting, bar chart, histogram, box plot,
        density curves, calibrated power curve, the reading and display
        of csv and other formatted data and color themes. The function
        Help provides a help system that suggests specific analyses and
        functions. Variable labels are available. A confirmatory factor
        analysis of multiple indicator measurement models is also
        available as well as pedagogical routines for data simulation
        such as for the Central Limit Theorem.
