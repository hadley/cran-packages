Description: Comprehensive implementation of Dynamic Time Warping
        algorithms in R. DTW finds the optimal (least cumulative
        distance) mapping between two time series.  All common DTW
        variants are covered, including local and global constraints,
        arbitrary timeseries lenghts, distance definitions, MVM, etc.
        Package computes cumulative distance, warping functions, plots,
        normalizations, etc.
