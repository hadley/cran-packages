Description: The package simulates phylogenetic trees under a
        constant-rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a
        fixed number of final tips, or a fixed age, or a fixed age and
        number of tips. When conditioning on the number of final tips,
        the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction
        events during the birth-death process. TreeSim further samples
        appropriately trees with n final tips from a set of trees
        generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a
        fixed number m>>n of leaves is first reached. This latter
        method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big
        class of models (details in the bd.gsa.taxa man page).
