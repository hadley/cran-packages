Description: This package provides some functions, data sets, and examples for
        performing statistical calibration, more generally known as inverse
        estimation, with linear and nonlinear regression models. Furthermore,
        a generic function is provided for plotting fitted regression models 
        with or without confidence/prediction bands that may be of use to the 
        general user.
