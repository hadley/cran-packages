        facilities such as the inclusion of output from R, the results
        of an R session, the display of mathematical expressions using
        LaTeX notation and the incorporation of SVG graphical objects.
        It uses MathJax to display mathematical expressions, in
        contrast to R2HTML which uses MathML.
