Description: Uses Protovis to provide web graphics for R (exposes most
        low-level functions).  Package is still under active
        development and shouldn't be considered stable until version
        0.1.  Currently uses a web browser to process JavaScript,
        although future version will process JavaScript directly and
        return the SVG output.  Also does not properly support discrete
        labels (e.g. with histograms) or statistical functions.  See
        website for more details.
