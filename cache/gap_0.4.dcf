Title: Genetic analysis package
Author: Jing hua Zhao in collaboration with other colleagues, and with
        help from Kurt Hornik of the R core development team
Maintainer: Jing hua Zhao <j.zhao@.ucl.ac.uk>
Depends: haplo.score
Description: This is an integrated package for genetic data analysis
        of both population and family data. It currently includes
        sample size calculations for both population-based and
        family-based designs, probability of familial disease
        aggregation, kinship calculation, statistics for linkage
        and association analysis involving one or more genetic
        markers including haplotype analysis. The future plan
        includes incorporation of programs for path analysis,
        segregation, and other statistics in linkage and association
        analysis.
License: Programs included in this package by Jing hua Zhao will be
        under GPL. Specific requirement may be possible for programs
        written by other authors.
