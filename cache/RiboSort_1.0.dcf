Description: RiboSort is an R package for rapid classification of (TRFLP &
	ARISA) microbial community profiles. Its function is to eliminate the
	laborious task of manually classifying community fingerprints in
	microbial studies. 
	By automatically assigning detected fragments and their respective 
	relative abundances to appropriate ribotypes, RiboSort saves time and 
	greatly simplifies the preparation of DNA fingerprint datasets for 
	statistical analysis.
